<p>In the first place, it <span class="corr" id="xd29e269" title="Source: recals">recalls</span> and strengthens the recollection of the first formation of that, which may now be
called an old friendship between us; from the continuance of which I have, from time

much rational recreation <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd29e272" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#xd29e272">viii</a>]</span>of mind, and which has, moreover, produced some of the happiest hours of my life.

<h2 class="main">NOTE EXPLANATORY OF THE ARGYLL PATRONIMIC OF MAC CHAILEAN MHOIR.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This patronimic of the noble family of Argyll has been strangely changed by Sir Walter
Scott, and others, into MacCallum More. The true orthography and reading of it is
Mac Chailein, that is, the son or descendant of Colin. M�r signifies great; and when
used in the genitive case as above, it is written Mhoir�pronounced V�r, or rather
Vore�having much the same sound as More in English.
</p>
<p>Mac Chailein Mhoir, the son of the Great Colin, or Mac Chailean, is synonymous in
Gaelic with Argyll; and M�r, <i>great</i>, makes it, in fact, the Great Argyll.
</p>
<p>Calain M�r�so called from his stature or his actions�was the eighth knight of Lochow
of the name of Campbell. He commanded the right wing of the Scottish army at the battle
of Largs, in the year 1263. His father Archibald was in life at the time, though Colin
led on the men of Argyll. Colin Mor was knighted by Alexander III. in the year 1280.
He was killed in a fight with John Bachach (that is, Lame John) MacDougald of Lorn
about the year 1293, in forcing a pass called the Ath-dearg, or the Bloody Ford, in
Lorn. His <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd29e304" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#xd29e304">x</a>]</span>remains were carried to Kilchrennan, on Lochow side, and interred in the parish churchyard,
where his tombstone is still a conspicuous object. From him the family of Argyll have
the patronimic of Mac Chailean Mhoir, or, as generally pronounced, Mac Calain M�r.
</p>
<p>The Author has to thank the Rev. Dr. Norman MacLeod of Glasgow for having afforded
him the information which has enabled him to give this explanation, and he is the
more grateful for it from the interest he personally takes in the memory of the heroic
Sir Colin, from whose great grand-daughter, Alicia, he has himself the honour of being
descended.

<h2 class="main">TO THE READER.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">These three volumes of Highland Legends are published in continuation of those which
appeared in 1837, and in pursuance of a plan�long cherished by the Author�of collecting,
and preserving in print, all the more interesting of the traditional and local histories
of the Highlanders that yet remain, but which, to the regret of all antiquaries, are
fast melting away. Not a year passes over us, that does not see some ancient Seanachaidh,
whom perhaps we may have known as the venerable historian of the district where he
lived,�to whose tales of love, strife, or peril, we may have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd29e313" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#xd29e313">xii</a>]</span>often listened with eager attention,�borne to his silent grave in the simple churchyard
of some lonely Highland parish, where his snow-white head is consigned to its parent
earth, and there left to moulder into dust and oblivion, together with all the legendary
lore which it contained. The Author has always had great pleasure in availing himself
of every opportunity that occurred to him, of conversing with those living records
of the glens, and he has never failed to write down whatsoever curious matter it may
have been his good fortune to gather from them. By such means, as well as by the assistance
of many kind friends, he has been enabled to make a very considerable collection of
these traditions, from all parts of the Highlands of Scotland; and, like all other
collectors, he has become only just so much the more insatiably avaricious to increase
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd29e315" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#xd29e315">xiii</a>]</span>his store, the larger that he sees the heap becoming.
</p>
<p>Such legends are not only curious and interesting in themselves, but they will often
prove to be helps to history, from the little incidents which they furnish, that may
throw light upon it. But, however they are to be estimated in this respect, they must
always be considered as having some value, from the pictures which they afford of
the manners of the times to which they belong.
</p>
<p>It is quite possible that many of these Traditions, in the course of their long descent
through successive ages, during which they have been distilled and redistilled through
the poetical imaginations of so many narrators, may have undergone considerable alteration,
and even, perhaps, in some instances, exaggeration. To many fervid minds <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd29e320" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#xd29e320">xiv</a>]</span>such an effect produced by their antiquity, may not render them one whit less palatable;
whilst people of a less romantic and more common-sense cast, will always be able to
winnow out for themselves the more solid grains from the glittering but empty chaff.
But any one, who, from the apparent improbability of some of their attendant circumstances,
should assert that such legends have no foundation in fact, would fall, it is apprehended,
into a very grievous error. The Author thinks that no legend, however improbable,
can have been created, without having had some foundation in reality,�some germ, in
short, from which it had its origin,�and perhaps he cannot better illustrate this
observation, or prove its truth, than by narrating a circumstance with the particulars
of which he was favoured by his friend the Venerable Archdeacon Williams, which shows
this connexion <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd29e322" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#xd29e322">xv</a>]</span>in the strongest light. What he has to tell, it is true, belongs more particularly
to the Principality of Wales, but it only furnishes a more than ordinarily curious
and striking example of a class, of which many similar samples might be easily produced
from the Highlands of Scotland, as well as from many other parts of the world.
</p>
<p>Some of the Welsh legendary historians tell us, that in the year 500, there flourished
a renowned chief called Benlli Gawr. His usual residence was where the present town
of Mold now stands, and his hill-fort, or place of strength was erected on the highest
of the Clwydian range, nearly due west from Mold, and about half way between that
place and Ruthin. The hill on which the remains of this fortalice still exist, is
called Moel Benlli, or the conical hill of Benlli, and it presents a conspicuous object
from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd29e326" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#xd29e326">xvi</a>]</span>Mold, Ruthin, and Denbigh. An immense <i>carnedd</i> or cairn of stones, which was still to be seen some years ago in an entire state
in a field about half a mile from the town of Mold, was supposed to have been the
place of this hero�s interment; and if we may believe what we read in the Welsh verses
on the graves of the warriors of the Isle of Britain, his son�s place of sepulture
was in a spot about eight miles distant, and is thus noticed in the following rhymes:�
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">�Pian y bed<sup>h</sup>d yn y Maes Mawr,
</p>
<p class="line">Balen a law ar ei larn awr:
</p>
<p class="line">Bed<sup>h</sup>d Beli ab Benlli Gawr.�</p>
</div>
<p class="first">That is,�
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">�He who owns the grave in the large field,
</p>
<p class="line">Proud his hand on his blade:
</p>
<p class="line">The grave of Beli, son of Benlli Gawr.�</p>
</div>
<p class="first">But to return to the great Carnedd of Benlli himself in the field near Mold. It was
always called Tomen y r Ellyllon, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd29e349" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#xd29e349">xvii</a>]</span>or the Tumulus of the Goblins, and for this reason, that from time immemorial it was
believed that the grim ghost of Benlli, in the form of a knight clad in splendid gear,
and especially wearing a Celain Aur, or golden corselet, appeared after sunset, standing
on the cairn, or walking round it, and that there he continued to maintain his cold
post, till the scent of the morning air, or the crowing of the cock, drove him to
the necessity of retiring from it to some more comfortable quarters. This legend had
for generations so terrified the people, that no bribe could have tempted any one
to have passed by that way after nightfall. Yet, though nobody went thither, and that
every possibility of having anything like direct evidence as to what the spectre knight�s
personal appearance and dress really were, had been thus precluded by the circumstance
that every one shunned <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd29e351" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#xd29e351">xviii</a>]</span>his dreaded presence, the most wonderful and incredible accounts of his stern countenance
and terrific bearing, together with the most fearful stories of their effects upon
people who had beheld them, continued to be propagated, although no one could specify
the individuals who had seen them, or been so affected by them.
</p>
<p>Towards the end of the year 1833, it happened that the occupier of the field where
the carnedd stood, took it into his head, that the stones of which it was composed
might be of use for the construction of a road, or for filling drains, or for some
such rural purpose. It was with some difficulty that he could procure workmen bold
enough to make such an assault on the very castle of the goblin, even although it
was to be carried on during the hours that the blessed sun was abroad. But having
at last succeeded <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd29e355" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#xd29e355">xix</a>]</span>in obtaining these, he proceeded to work, and soon drove away some four or five hundred
cart-loads of stones from the cairn, when, at last, the workmen came upon something
of a strange shape, which was manifestly constructed of some sort of metal. It was
with no little dread that they ventured to touch it, but their observation having
led them to believe that it was some old brass pot-lid or frying-pan, it ceased to
be an object either of dread or of interest in their unlearned eyes, and they threw
it carelessly into a hedge, where it lay all night neglected.
</p>
<p>Some person of education having come to the spot next morning, who had heard of such
a thing having been found, was led by curiosity to examine it, when, to the astonishment
of all who heard of it, the brazen frying-pan was discovered to be a lorica, or corselet
of gold.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd29e359" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#xd29e359">xx</a>]</span></p>
<p>The metal was found to be of about the same degree of purity as our present coin.
It was so thin, that it weighed altogether no more than sixty sovereigns, and therefore
it appears evident that it could not have been used as armour of defence in combat.
It is more than probable that it must have been worn merely as an ornamental piece
of armour on occasions of state or parade, in which case it was, very likely, originally
lined with leather. It was embossed all over it, of a simple pattern, but it was not
perforated.
</p>
<p>The obliging correspondent through whose kindness, and that of his friends, I have
become possessed of these very remarkable facts, amuses himself by calculating the
immense value which such a piece of dress must have had in the time of Benlli-Gawr,
its wearer, that is, in the year 500. �This,� says he, �may be done by referring to
the ancient laws of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd29e364" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#xd29e364">xxi</a>]</span>Wales, now publishing under the Government Commission. In these laws, the average
price of a cow was five shillings, and allowing for the difference in the value of
money, a cow would now cost about ten pounds. Then one pound at that time would buy
four cows, and the ten pounds would buy forty cows, and the sixty sovereigns would
be the value of two hundred and forty cows, or two thousand four hundred pounds sterling.�
</p>
<p>This curious and highly valuable <i>morceau</i> of antiquity was immediately claimed by the Honourable Edward Mostyn Lloyd Mostyn
as lord of the manor, and by Colonel Salusbury of Gallbfarnan as the possessor of
the field where it was found, and the law having determined that it should belong
to the former gentleman, it is now in his possession. It is gratifying to the Author
to think, that it should have fallen into the hands of Mr. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd29e370" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#xd29e370">xxii</a>]</span>Mostyn, with whom he has since had the honour of becoming acquainted, during the Welsh
Eisteddvod, held at Liverpool, where, as President of that body, his high attainments�his
courteous manners�and his ardent devotion to the cause of the preservation of Welsh
literature and antiquities, gave universal satisfaction to all present, and afforded
a sufficient assurance for the safety of the interesting relic, of which an account
has been given.
</p>
<p>This is certainly a very powerful instance of the soundness of the proposition, that
legendary tales, however incredible many of their circumstances may be, have always
some foundation in truth. It appears to be by no means difficult to speculate reasonably
enough on the probabilities of the matter in this case; and it would seem that they
have in all likelihood been these:�In the year 500 or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd29e374" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#xd29e374">xxiii</a>]</span>thereabouts, the renowned hero, Benlli, died, and in obedience to his own last instructions,
or of those of his son, Beli, or of some other relative or friend, he was buried in
the tumulus with his golden corselet on, and then the carnedd was heaped up over his
remains. To prevent the risk of any avaricious follower or serf, or any other promiscuous
pilferer, uncovering his body during the night, in order to possess himself of the
glittering prize, his surviving friends circulate the story that his ghost, frowning
fearfully, as such ghosts are wont, is seen nightly to guard the tumulus, girt in
the golden armour. Terror fills the superstitious minds of the inhabitants of the
district, and no man for his life will venture to approach the Carnedd after sunset.
This lie protective is thus very naturally and innocently handed down from one generation
of the superstitious people <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd29e376" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#xd29e376">xxiv</a>]</span>of the neighbourhood to that which succeeds it, and implicitly believed; and so the
story is traditionally preserved for about fourteen hundred years, until it is now
at last unravelled, in our own time, by the removal of the Carnedd of stones, and
the discovery of the golden corselet itself.
</p>
<p>Let not any one refuse then to give credence to the main circumstances of these our
Highland Legends, because they may perhaps be somewhat overlaid with circumstances
of a romantic or doubtful nature, but let the judgment rather be exercised to discover,
and to discriminate, between the thread of the true and original history, and those
adventitious filaments of later manufacture which have from time to time been introduced
and interwoven with it. This will generally be found to be no very difficult task,
and there are many by whom it will be considered rather as an agreeable amusement,
than as an irksome occupation.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We left the Highland village of Tomantoul after an early breakfast, and proceeded
to wend our way slowly up the pastoral valley of Aven. The scenery as yet had nothing
peculiarly striking about it, but our faces were turned towards the Cairngorm group
of mountains, and the closing in of the hills forming the termination of our present
view, already excited interesting expectation regarding those higher regions which
arose beyond them. This was especially the case with my fellow-travellers, who had
not previously visited this elevated district. A certain <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb2">2</a>]</span>air of tranquil repose that hung over every thing around us, and gave an indescribable
charm to the simple features of nature, rather disposed our minds to quiet and passive
enjoyment, so that we walked leisurely along for some time, less inclined to talk
than to ruminate each within himself. Our young friend Clifford was the first to break
silence.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Clifford.</span>�What a beautiful little plain!�How animating the clear river that waters it, with
its stream sparkling under the bright morning sun!�And see how appropriate the few
figures that give life to it. Those cattle there, so agreeably disposed, cropping
the fresh herbage, with that boy so intent upon plaiting a cap of rushes for the innocent
little girl who sits beside him. It would make a subject for a Cuyp or a Paul Potter.
What a scene of simple happiness, contentment, and peace!
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Dominie Macpherson.</span>�It is indeed a quiet enough scene at this moment, sir. But peaceful as it is at this
present time, it hath not been always so, for it hath more than once had its green
turf trodden into black and dusty earth <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb3">3</a>]</span>by the thundering hoof of the neighing battle-steed. The day has been, Mr. Clifford,
when, as Maro has it:�
</p>
<div lang="la" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">�����������Agmine facto
</p>
<p class="line">Quadrupedante putrem sonitu quatit ungula campum.�</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Here it was, sir, that Montrose encampit with his army in 1645, alter having defeated
the godly sons of the covenant in the bloody field of Auldern, and before marching
to glut his cruel spirit by massacring more of them at Alford on the Don. And, as
if the soil of this fair spot had not been thus sufficiently polluted, it so chanced
that, in June 1689, the bloody Clavers also cumbered it with himself and his followers
on his way to the Pass of Killiecrankie, where, on the 16th of July thereafter, praise
be to the Lord, his wicked existence was at last put an end to.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Grant.</span>�Ha! These historical recollections do indeed give a new interest to the scene.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Clifford.</span>�Only fancy the motley troops, in the varied military costume of the time, drawn up
here in their lines, the tents and huts stretching <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb4">4</a>]</span>along yonder in regular order,�the mingled sounds arising from the busy camp followers,�the
trumpets clanging,�and the bold Dundee scampering across the plain on his gallant
black charger! What a contrast to the figures which are now before us!
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Dominie.</span>�Aye; and if all tales be true, he was but an uncanny beast that black hone of his.
But, my certy! the beast and the man were well matched.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Clifford.</span>�You seem to have a great distaste at the Viscount Dundee, Mr. Macpherson, and yet
he was followed by the great mass of your Highland clans.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Dominie.</span>�That may be, Mr. Clifford; but that makes no odds to me, sir. I am in no ways answerable
for the deeds of my forebears. If they turned out to support popery and yepiscopacy,
that is not what I would have done. I reverence the manes of those sainted heroes
who drew their good broadswords for God and the Covenant, and who suffered all manner
of tortures and all kinds of cruel deaths rather than abandon so glorious a cause,�a
cause, let me tell you, with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb5">5</a>]</span>all due respeck to you, Mr. Clifford,�a cause in which I should be proud to die at
this moment.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Clifford.</span>�Your enthusiasm is not only excusable, but honourable to you, Mr. Macpherson. But
will you tell me the name of this spot, that I may endeavour to remember it?
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Dominie.</span>�It is called Dell-a-Vorar, or the Lord�s-haugh, a name which it got from one, or
may be from both of these two lords I have named, though it is more probable that
it was from Clavers, seeing that the place in Braemar to which he marched from here
has ever since borne the same name.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Grant.</span>�I know there is a place in Braemar so called.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Author.</span>�By the bye, Mr. Macpherson, does not the dwelling of Willox the wizard lie somewhere
in this neighbourhood?
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Dominie.</span>�Yes, sir, it does. Gaulrig, as the place is called, lies up beyond yon hollow in
the hill on the right side of the glen which you see before us yonder, dipping into
the valley of the Aven from the north.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb6">6</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="sc">Clifford.</span>�Let us visit the old fellow by all means, Mr. Macpherson.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Dominie.</span>�We may easily do that, sir, for the house is not much out of your way, and we are
pretty sure of finding him, for he is too old now to be often or far from home.
</p>
<p>A walk of some couple of miles brought us to the place where we found the residence
of this extraordinary man, standing on the sloping side of the northern hill, immediately
below a small tributary ravine, which ancient popular superstition has very appropriately
consigned to the dominion of the fairies, and other beings belonging to the world
of spirits, and in which there is one of those green artificial-looking knolls called
<i>shians</i>, from their being supposed to be places of especial fairy resort. His cottage hangs
on the edge of the bank facing the Aven, is of the most primitive architecture, composed
of drystones and sods, and forms, with its humble out-houses, two sides of a small
square. Near one angle of the house there is a rude stone, on which the old warlock
is in the habit of sitting to enjoy the sun.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb7">7</a>]</span></p>
<p>Understanding that Willox was at all times rather flattered by a visit from strangers,
we made no scruple in requesting an interview with him; and, accordingly, he soon
appeared from the door of his dwelling. Notwithstanding all that Mr. Macpherson had
said to the contrary, I had found it a difficult matter to persuade myself that I
was not to see a vulgar countenance, strongly marked with that species of sordid cunning,
which one might suppose sufficient to enable a knave, of the lowest description, to
impose on the most ignorant class of rustics. The figure of the man, indeed, who now
showed himself, had nothing about it to do away with this preconceived notion of mine.
He was rather under the middle size, and was dressed in the ordinary <i>hodden grey</i> clothes, which have now so generally usurped the place of the gayer tartans, and
more picturesque highland dress. But I at once perceived that his low stature was
to be attributed to the decrepitude of old age, for he was probably above ninety.
The moment he put forth his head from the threshold, and perceived those who sought
for an <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb8">8</a>]</span>interview with him, an inconceivable expression flashed from his eyes, which, I might
almost say, threw over him a certain light of dignity. We were all of us at once convinced
that this was no common man, and our regard was riveted upon him. It seemed as if
the native lightnings of an uneducated, but naturally very powerful mind, were bursting
through the obscurity of those grey orbs, which had been dimmed by the gathering mists
of many a long year. The half dormant spirit appeared to have been suddenly summoned
to the portal of the eye, by this anticipated interview with people whom he had never
seen before, just as, in the olden time, the jealous captain of a fortress might have
been brought to its barbican by the bugle call of some knight of doubtful mien who
wished to hold parley.
</p>
<p>As he advanced to meet us, I was struck with the corselike paleness of his face, to
which the glaze of his eyeballs, and the grizzly and tangled locks that strayed from
beneath his bonnet, gave an inexpressibly ghastly effect. A transient gleam of electric
fire shot from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb9">9</a>]</span>within his eyeballs into each of our countenances individually, as he was introduced
to us in succession. We felt as if it had penetrated into the inmost recesses of our
very souls. It appeared to us as if he had thereby been enabled, from long practice
in the study of mankind, at once to read our several characters and thoughts, like
so many lines of the great book of nature hastily skimmed over. To each of us in turn
he bowed with a polished air, and a manner <span class="corr" id="xd29e473" title="Source: liker">like</span> that of a faded courtier of the age of Louis Quatorze, than the inhabitant of so
humble a dwelling, in the simple and pastoral valley of Strathdawn; and strangely
indeed did it contrast with the coarseness and poverty of his dress, and the squalid
<i lang="fr">impropret�</i> of his whole personal appearance.
</p>
<p>After the usual preliminary salutations were over, I expressed a wish to see the far-famed
magical kelpie�s bridle and mermaid�s stone, for the possession of which he is so
celebrated in all the neighbouring districts.
</p>
<p>�You shall see them both, sir,� said he, after eyeing me for a moment with a searching
look. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb10">10</a>]</span>�To such gentlemen as you, I cannot refuse a sight of them, though they are hardly
to be seen by vulgar eyes, and never to be handled by vulgar hands;� and, with a marked
politeness of manner, he returned into the cottage to bring them out.
</p>
<p>�Now,� said I to my companions, �you must keep him in talk, whilst I endeavour to
steal a sketch of him.�
</p>
<p>�Here are the wonderful implements of my art,� said he, as he returned, holding them
up to our observation.
</p>
<p>�They are very curious,� said I; �perhaps you will have the goodness to allow me to
make a hasty drawing of them. I hope it will have no effect in taking away their virtues.
</p>
<p>�Their virtues cannot be taken away by human hands,� replied Willox, gravely. �You
are welcome to draw them if you please, sir, and I shall hold them for you so that
you may best see them.�
</p>
<p>I thanked him, and proceeded instantly to my work. My friends followed my injunctions
so well as fully to occupy his attention in replying <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb11">11</a>]</span>to their cross fire of queries, whilst I was myself obliged to interject a question
now and then, in order to get him to turn his countenance towards me. The wonderful
expression I have already alluded to appeared even yet more striking, on these occasions,
by his ghost-like features being brought so closely and directly opposite to my eyes.
I then looked in as it were upon his spirit,�and it was manifestly a spirit which,
in ancient days, when superstition brooded as much over the proud castle of the bold
baron, as it did over the humble cot of the timid peasant, might well enough have
domineered over the minds of nobles and princes, nay subjected even crowned heads
to its powerful control.
</p>
<p>I did make sketches of the <i>mermaid�s stone</i> and the <i>water-kelpie�s bridle</i>, the two grand instruments of his art. As already described to us by Mr. Macpherson,
we found the stone to be a circular and flattish lens, three inches diameter, of semi-opaque
<span class="corr" id="xd29e499" title="Source: chrystal">crystal</span>, somewhat resembling, in shape and appearance, what is called a bull�s eye, used
for transmitting light through the deck of a vessel into its smaller <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb12">12</a>]</span>apartments below. The water-kelpie�s bridle consists of a flat piece of brass, annular
in the middle, and having two lobe-like branches springing from it in two curves outwards,
the wider part of each lobe being slightly recurved inwards, so that they present
the appearance of two leaves when they are held flat. Attached to the ring part, but
loose upon it, are two long doubled pieces of flat brass, and, between these, a short
leathern thong is attached by a fastening so intricate that it might have rivalled
the Gordian knot. It has not the most distant resemblance to any part of a bridle,
and none of us could guess to what purpose, either useful or ornamental, it could
have ever been applied. Willox�s own account of the acquirement of these two wonderful
engines of his supernatural power, elicited by our repeated questions, was nearly
as follows:�
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb13">13</a>]</span></p>

<h2 class="main">THE WATER-KELPIE�S BRIDLE AND THE MERMAID�S STONE.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">My grand-uncle Macgregor, was so much devoted to the study of that mysterious and
unpronounceable art which gives man control over the world of spirits, that he ultimately
became a powerful adept in it. He lived on the banks of the river Dulnan, in Strathspey,
and his fame went so much abroad, that his name was never mentioned without reverential
awe. Whilst involved in the pursuit of these studies, he was much used to take solitary
walks, during which it was believed that he held high converse with beings rarely
brought within the reach of human communing.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb14">14</a>]</span></p>
<p>He was walking one evening on the lonely shore of Loch-an-dorbe. The sky was calm,
but the air was hot and sulphurous, and the sun went down in a blood-red haze, that
the gifted eye of Macgregor knew to be portentous. Wrapped in his plaid, he leaned
against a huge stone, and stood earnestly gazing at the sinking orb till it had altogether
disappeared. He read therein that some mighty deed was to be achieved, and he wound
himself up to encounter whatever adventure might befall him.
</p>
<p>Suddenly the black waters of the lake began to heave from their centre without any
seeming cause. Not a breath of wind stirred them, yet they came boiling outwards,
so as at once to dash their waves on every part of the surrounding shores. A dark
object was seen to bound forth upon the beach at no great distance from the spot where
Macgregor stood. A less strongly fortified heart would have quailed with fear, but
his was armed with potent spells. He stretched his eyeballs towards the object, when,
less to his astonishment than delight, he beheld a black <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb15">15</a>]</span>horse, of immense size, and of beautiful proportions, approaching him through the
lurid twilight. On he came, prancing proudly along the strand, pawing the ground from
time to time, and neighing aloud with a voice of thunder, while blue lightnings were
ever and anon darting from his expanded nostrils, and his eyes were shining like stars.
It required not Macgregor�s skill to know that this was no ordinary horse, but his
superhuman knowledge made him at once aware that it was the water-kelpie himself,
and he watched his coming with a heart beating high with hope. Well instructed as
to the measures which it now became necessary for him to adopt, he stood aside behind
the large stone, and employed certain charms which he knew would aid in his concealment;
and as this terrific incarnation of the spirit of the waters was curvetting grandly
past him, he sprang suddenly out upon him, and, seizing his bridle with his left hand,
he raised aloft his gleaming claymore with his right, and cut it out of the water-kelpie�s
head at one blow. In an instant the terrible spirit was metamorphosed into <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb16">16</a>]</span>the shape of a man of huge and very formidable appearance.
</p>
<p>�Give me back my bridle, thou son of earth!� cried he, in a voice like the roaring
of a cataract.
</p>
<p>�No!� said Macgregor, boldly; �I have won it, and I shall keep it.�
</p>
<p>�Then,� roared the enraged spirit, �you and it shall never enter your house together!�
</p>
<p>Macgregor staid not to hear more, but ran off in the direction of his home, from which
he was then distant a good many miles. The enraged spirit came roaring and howling
after him. Ten thousand floods pouring down over the rocky ridge of Ben Nevis could
not have created so appalling a combination of terrific sounds. The hot breath of
the fiend came about Macgregor as he flew, as if it would have threatened suffocation.
Lucky was it for my granduncle that the kelpie, in losing his bridle, had also lost
with it, for the time at least, the power of becoming a horse, else had his chance
of escape been small indeed. As it was, however, it seemed as if Macgregor had suddenly
acquired a large proportion of those racing qualities which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb17">17</a>]</span>were derived from that magical virtue so strongly inherent in the bridle which he
bore; for he appeared, even to himself, rather to skim than to run over the vast extent
of moors, hills, and bogs that lay between him and his own home, scarcely bending
the heather tops in his way, so lightly and rapidly did his feet fly over the ground.
But great as was the supernatural speed he had acquired, that of the water-kelpie
was so little short of it, that the wicked spirit was close at his heels when he reached
his own house. With a presence of mind, and an adroitness, which no one but an experienced
and expert adept in the management of a contest with powers naturally so superior
to man, could have commanded or exercised, he avoided entering by the door, although
it stood yawning temptingly wide to receive him. Luckily a window was open. �Hulloo!�
cried he hastily to his wife, whom he happily observed within, �catch this in your
apron!� And, throwing the bridle to her through the window, he cunningly avoided the
denunciation which the kelpie had uttered against him.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb18">18</a>]</span></p>
<p>No sooner did the kelpie perceive that he was thus outwitted, than he shrieked so
loud that all the hills of Strathspey re-echoed again.�Yes, you need not stare, gentlemen;
I tell you that the mountains echoed again, as if the lofty Craig Ellachie had rent
itself from its foundations, and rolled itself into the river Spey. The water-kelpie
disappeared, and, what is strange, he has never since been seen by mortal man. But
my grand-uncle Macgregor had his bridle, which, as you see, afterwards descended from
him to me.
</p>
<p>The story of the acquirement of the Mermaid�s Stone is no whit less extraordinary
than that of the bridle. The stone came to me from my maternal grandfather, who gained
it by the superhuman powers which he possessed; for in my veins two most potent streams
of necromantic blood have united themselves, though it would ill become me to say
that I have ever equalled my ancestors. After having made frequent visits to the sea
coast, my grandfather at last found out the spot where a beautiful mermaid was wont
to sport amid the shallows, and sit on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb19">19</a>]</span>a rock, to comb her long hair, and to sing the most exquisite melodies. Long and anxiously
did he watch her motions, till he perceived her one day combing her lovely tresses
over her face and bosom, altogether unconscious that she was observed. Arming himself
with certain spells which he possessed, which gave him superhuman powers, he crept
into the sea from the rocky point where he lay concealed, and wading silently towards
the stone where she sat, he came behind her, and clasping her eagerly in his arms,
he held her fast, and, in spite of all her wailings, her lamentations, and her struggles,
he succeeded in carrying her on shore. When fairly on land, she became exceedingly
helpless, so that he had no farther trouble with her, and, delighted with his fair
prize, he brought her home in triumph. There he made a soft bed for her upon the rafters
of the house; and although he was unwillingly compelled by prudence to make sure of
her by subjecting her to the restraint of tying her to the couples of the roof, he
in all other respects lavished the utmost kindness upon her.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb20">20</a>]</span></p>
<p>So very much, indeed, was my grandfather taken up with his new acquisition, that my
grandmother began to grow jealous of his attentions to the fair sea nymph; and, more
out of spite, perhaps, than from any real wickedness, she began to encourage the visits
of a young man who had been formerly attached to her. Now, strange as it may seem,
it is no less true, that, great as were my grandfather�s powers in the art magic,
he was yet unable thereby to discover the fact, that his wife received the visits
of this lover, on certain occasions, when his trifling affairs required his absence
from home. Now, it happened one day that my grandfather returned so suddenly, and
so unexpectedly, that his wife was compelled to conceal the youth hastily behind a
bed. The lady was in a terrible taking, you may believe; but she so far subdued her
agitation as to receive her husband with every possible appearance of kindness and
affection.
</p>
<p>�I dreamed a strange dream last night,� said she, after fully recovering her presence
of mind, and smiling gaily. �I dreamed that I put <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb21">21</a>]</span>both my hands over your eyes, and yet you saw as well as if they had not been there.�
</p>
<p>�Come try, then!� replied her husband sportively, taking what she said as the mere
prelude to some little innocent matrimonial frolic; �come try then, my dear. I believe
I can see as far into a millstone as most people.�
</p>
<p>�No doubt you can,� said his spouse, laughing outright, and approaching him with a
merry air, she clapped her hands so firmly over his eyes that he was completely blindfolded,
�now can you see?� exclaimed she.
</p>
<p>�No!� replied the husband, �not one whit.�
</p>
<p>�Stay a little,� cried his wife, laughing heartily again, �depend upon it this miraculous
light will come to you at last!�
</p>
<p>�Aye, aye!� cried he, struggling till he escaped from her hands, and then kissing
her heartily, �I see now well enough.� But, alas! my grandfather�s vision had come
too late, for the lover had availed himself of this brief opportunity, so cunningly
afforded him, to make his escape.
</p>
<p>The mermaid, who was seated on the rafters <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb22">22</a>]</span>above, laughed aloud with an unearthly laughter, as she witnessed the trick that had
been played to my grandfather. To divert her husband�s attention from a mirth that
at first appalled her, the lady, with great presence of mind, threw down the girdle-stone,
a flat stone, which in those primitive times was used for firing the oaten cakes,
instead of the iron plate of that name, which now forms so important an article of
furniture in the kitchen of every Scottish cottage. The stone was broken to pieces,
and the lady�s loud lamentation for this apparently accidental misfortune, quickly
diverted her husband�s attention from the mysterious merriment of the mermaid, and
having thus effected her purpose, she threw the fragments of the stone out on the
dunghill.
</p>
<p>The poor mermaid pined and sighed for her native element, until she wrung the heart
of her captor to pity.
</p>
<p>�Take me but down to the sea,� said she with her sweet voice, �take me but down to
the sea, and put me but into the waves�but three yards from the shore�and it shall
be better for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb23">23</a>]</span>thee than all the good thou can�st gain by keeping me here.�
</p>
<p>Softened to compliance at last, my grandfather did take her down from the rafters,
and carrying her to the coast, he waded into the sea with her, the three yards she
had specified, and put her gently down amid the waves, near the very stone where he
had originally caught her. The joy of this beautiful marine spirit in finding herself
thus again bathing in the invigorating waters of her own native ocean, after having
been so long hung up, as it were, on the rafters of a Highland cottage, to be smoked
like an Aberdeen haddock, or a kipper salmon, may be easily imagined. But, although
wicked people might perhaps impute her parting speech more to that natural love of
scandal which is said to belong to her sex, than to any strong feeling for my grandfather,
yet we must say, that her words and her counsel shewed that her gratitude was no less
abundant than her joy. Turning to him who had treated her so compassionately, she
passed her taper fingers gracefully through her <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb24">24</a>]</span>long silken tresses, and thus addressed him with her siren tongue:�
</p>
<p>�Travel not so oft nor so far from home again! Ill luck attends that home whence the
master often wanders. Dost thou remember my loud laugh on that day when thy wife broke
the girdle stone? It was because she made a fool of thee by blinding thine eyes that
her lover might escape unseen. Be wiser in future, and never leave home; and when
you go back now, look among the straw where the broken bits of the girdle stone were
thrown, and you will find that which will be a treasure to you and to your children
for ever.�
</p>
<p>With these words she dived among the breakers and was seen by him no more. My grandfather
returned home rather chopfallen; but on searching where the mermaid had indicated
to him, he found that very stone, which has now, for three generations, been the agent
in performing so many wonders.

<h2 class="main">THE DOMINIE DEPARTS.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Soon after quitting the dwelling of the Warlock, we were doomed to lose the company
of one, with whom we were all much more unwilling to part.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Dominie Macpherson.</span>�I can hardly bring myself to tell you, gentlemen, that I must now�sore against my
will�take my humble leave of you. My road to my brother�s house lies north over the
hill there. But ere I go, I am truly glad to have it in my power to put you under
the guidance of my good friend, Serjeant Archy Stewart. I sent him a message last
night to come and meet us here; and there is the very man coming over the knoll, with
his Sabbath-day�s jacket and bonnet on.�How is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb26">26</a>]</span>all with you, Serjeant? My certy, I need not ask, for you look stout and hearty.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant Archy Stewart.</span>�Thank ye, Mr. Macpherson, I cannot complain. I am a little the worse for the wear�but
my old legs, such as they be, are fit enough for the hill yet. I am glad to see you
well back in the country again.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Dominie.</span>�Thank ye, Serjeant. Now, my good man, these are the three gentlemen you are to guide.
Three better gentlemen you never fell in with in all your travels. You must do all
you can for them; and, above all things, be sure to give them plenty of your cracks.
They like to hear all manner of auld-warld stories; so, as you must put on a budget
of their <span class="corr" id="xd29e577" title="Source: provi-visions">provisions</span> on your back�which, by the bye, will be like �sop�s burden, always growing less,�you
may e�en lighten yourself as you go of as many of the auncient legends which you carry
in your head as may help to ease your travel.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant.</span>�Uh! I�ll not be slack at that, Mr. Macpherson, I promise ye, if it be the pleasure
of the gentlemen.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb27">27</a>]</span></p>
<p>I shall not attempt to describe the scene of our parting with the worthy schoolmaster.
It threw a gloom over us all. As for the good man himself, his voice trembled�his
lip quivered�and his eyes filled with moisture, when he pronounced that most unpleasant
of all words�farewell�and gave us the last cordial shake of the hand, pouring out
his best wishes and blessings upon us. He then put his stick firmly to the ground,
as if to help his failing resolution, and, as he took his way over the hill, he turned
and waved�and turned and waved, twenty times at least, e�er he disappeared from our
sight.
</p>
<p>Our attention was now directed towards Serjeant Archy Stewart, who was cheerfully
occupying himself in shouldering a portion of our necessaries. He was a veteran of
about sixty years of age, of middle size, and of a hardy, wiry, though not very robust
frame. His fresh coloured countenance was lighted up by a pair of small, grey, and
very intelligent eyes; and its bold forehead, aquiline nose, high cheek-bones, and
prominent chin and lips, exhibited traits of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb28">28</a>]</span>a very undaunted and indomitable resolution, which his whole appearance showed had
been well tried by hardships. All this, however, was tempered and sweetened with so
perfect an expression of courtesy and good humour, pervading every line of his weather-beaten
features, that he instantly gained the golden opinions of our party. After adjusting
the wallet to his back, he pointed his hazel stick to the grass, and led the way before
us with an activity much beyond his years.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Clifford.</span>�Capital fishing hereabouts, no doubt, Mr. Stewart?
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant.</span>�Just grand, sir�no better in this, or any other country side.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Clifford.</span>�You know the river well, I suppose?
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant.</span>�Few should know it better, sir�for I�ve known it ever since I could look out over
the nest.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Clifford.</span>�You are a native of these mountains, then?�Come! we have been told that you are full
of their legendary lore, and we look to have much of it out of you ere we part.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb29">29</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant.</span>�I am sure your honor is welcome to as much as you can take and I can give you.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Clifford.</span>�Come away then�you shall begin, if you please, by giving us your own history.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant.</span>�Oh troth, sir, my history is little worth; but, such as it is, you shall have it.
I was born in this very glen here�for I am come of the Clan-Allan Stewarts, who were
the offspring of Sir Allan Stewart, who was said to have been a natural son of the
Yearl of Moray.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Author.</span>�What Earl of Moray was that, Archy?
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant.</span>�Really and truly I cannot tell you, sir. But this I know well enough, that them Clan-Allan
Stewarts were a proud, powerful, domineering race, and always reported to have been
very troublesome customers to those who happened to have any feud with them. I�ve
heard say, indeed, that while they boore sway here away, fint a man of any other name
dared to blow his nose throughout the whole of Strathdawn without their leave being
first asked and granted. Wild chields they were, I�ll warrant ye.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb30">30</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="sc">Author.</span>�That may be, Serjeant; but I shrewdly suspect that you are not altogether right in
your genealogy. My belief is, that it does in reality go somewhat farther back than
you suppose.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant.</span>�Do you think so, sir? Well it may be so.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Author.</span>�I am inclined to think that you must be come of the old Stewarts, Earls of Atholl.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant.</span>�Aye, aye!�Yearls of Athol!�that would be strange. But what makes you think that,
sir?
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Author.</span>�Why, we know that it was through the marriage of Alexander, third Earl of Huntly,
with the Lady Johanna Stewart, daughter of one of these Earls, in 1474, that Strathdawn
first came into the family of the Gordons, with whom it still remains. It is therefore
clear that Sir Allan, your ancestor, must have come here considerably before that
period; and if your forefathers, the Clan-Allan Stewarts, were such hard-headed, knock-me-down,
domineering fellows as you would seem to say they were, it is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb31">31</a>]</span>by no means improbable that they may have managed, by the use of their swords, to
bear sway here for many a long day, after the lands were chartered to the Gordons.

an auncient legend of the Stewarts of Clan-Allan, in which a speech of the old Lord

<h2 class="main">HISTORY OF SERJEANT ARCHY STEWART.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Well, Gentlemen�as I was telling you, I was born in Strathdawn here�as pretty a glen
as there is in all Scotland. Oh, what a bonny glen it was in my young days! You see
plain enough, without my telling you, that there are no trees now in it to speak of�none,
indeed, but a parcel of straggling patches and bushes of aller and birch and hazel
about the bit water-runs and burnies, or hanging here and there on the brae sides.
But when I was a boy, the hills were all one thick wood of tall trees, that gave shelter
to great herds of deer in the winter. Now, alas! the trees have fallen, and the deer,
annoyed and persecuted by sheep, shepherds, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb33">33</a>]</span>and sheep-dogs, have longsyne retreated to the upper mountains and vallies of the
Cairngorms, save may be, at an <i>anterin</i><a class="noteref" id="xd29e674src" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#xd29e674">1</a> time, when severe weather on the heights, may drive an odd few of them down upon
us for a short season.
</p>
<p>Well, gentlemen�not to detain you with my school-boy days�(for I <i>was</i> at school, gentlemen�and not so bad a scholar neither)�when I grew up to be a stout
lad, I left the glen, with six others of my own age, to go and seek for work in the
south country. I shall never forget that day that we left it. We went off full of
life and joy�for we thought but little of leaving our friends or the scenes of our
youth, since we trusted that the same firm legs that were carrying us away could at
any time bring us back to them the moment we had the will to return. We panted to
see the world, and it was now opening before us. All the fanciful dreams of our boyhood
were, as we thought, now about to be realized. Light, I trow, were our hearts, and
full were we of hopes, as we made our way across the Grampians, and in a few days
these hopes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb34">34</a>]</span>were realized, by our finding ourselves busily employed, and working hard, though
at good wages, in a quarry near Cupar in Fife.
</p>
<p>There we continued for some time perfectly contented with our labour, as well as with
the price of it, till John Grant of Lurg, grandson of the famous Robert of Lurg, well
known by the nick-name of <i>Old Stachcan</i>, or the stubborn��
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Clifford</span> (<i>breaking in on the <span class="corr" id="xd29e693" title="Source: Sergeant�s">Serjeant�s</span> narrative</i>.)�What! the fierce looking fellow whose picture we saw at Castle Grant with a pistol
in his hand?
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant</span>.�Just exactly�the very same, sir�he has a pistol in his hand in the picture, and
well, I promise you, did he know how to use it when he was in the body. Well, it was
his grandson, John of Lurg, who, some how or other, smelt us out in the place where
we then were in Fife; and as he was at that time raising men for a company, you may
well believe that his joy was not small when he thus came, like a setting dog, to
a dead point on such a covey of stout young Hillantmen in a quarry. He soon contrived
to get about us altogether, and with a hantel of fair words, and mony a bonny <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb35">35</a>]</span>speech about our Hillant hills�Hillant glens�Hillant waters�Hillant lasses�and, what
was more to his purpose at the time, about Hillant deeds of arms�all of which, observe
ye, gentlemen, were made over a reeking bowl of punch that you might have swum in,
he very soon succeeded in stirring up the fire of military ambition within our souls,
until he ultimately so inflamed us, that, with all the ease in life, he quickly converted
us, who were nothing unwilling, from hard-working quarriers, into gentlemen sodgers,
by enlisting us, all in a bunch, into the ninety-seventh regiment, or Inverness Highlanders.
</p>
<p>I need not tell you all the outs-and-ins of adventures that befel me while I was in
the ninety-seventh, in which corps I remained about two years and a half. But I may
mention to you, that I was serving with it when I got my first wound�I mean this bit
crack here, gentlemen�(and he pulled up his trews, and shewed his right leg immediately
below the knee, which was shrunken up to half the thickness of the other, from having
had the greater part of the muscles utterly destroyed.)�Some way or another, they
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb36">36</a>]</span>took it into their heads to put us on board of the Orion, one of the ships of Lord
Bridport�s squadron, to act as marines�an odd sort of duty truly for Hillantmen, and
one, I�ll assure you, that we by no means liked over much, seeing that, on board of
a ship, we were obliged to stand to be peppered at like brancher crows on a tree,
without the power of having our will out against the villains, by charging them with
the baggonet, as we should have done had we been opposed to them on dry land; and,
indeed, we soon felt the frost of this, when we came to be engaged in the action fought
with the French fleet on the 23d of June 1795.
</p>
<p>On that day, the French had twelve line-of-battle ships, besides a number of frigates
and other smaller vessels. From all their man�uvres it was very clear that they did
not wish to face us�for they stole off in a very dignified manner, never looking over
their shoulders all the time, as they were fain to have made us believe that they
never saw us at all, or that we were quite beneath their notice. But it was no time
for us to stand upon ceremony.�We after them <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb37">37</a>]</span>full sail, and we soon made them condescend to attend to us. In spite of all they
could do we brought them to action in L�Orient Bay. There we lethered them handsomely,
and we very speedily took from them three great ships, the Alexander, the Formidable,
and the <i>Tigger</i>; and, if it had not been for the batteries on shore, there was no doubt that we should
have had every keel of them. Well, you see, gentlemen, a large splinter of oak�rent
away from the ship�s side by a cannon shot�took me just below the knee, and demolished
the shape of my leg in the ugly fashion I showed you this moment. But I was young
then, and hearty, and no very easily daunted or cast down, so that I was soon out
of the doctor�s list, and on duty again.
</p>
<p>But what was far worse than all the wounds that my body could have suffered, though
it had been shot and drilled through and through like a riddle, was that which befel
me at Hilsea barracks after we returned to Britain. You know very well, gentlemen,
that the Bible says, �a wounded speerit who can bear?� Now, you may guess what were
the wounds of my speerit, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb38">38</a>]</span>and, consequently, what were my sufferings, when I and some of my Hillant comrades
were told, that we were to be immediately drafted into the ninth, or East Norfolk�an
English regiment!
</p>
<p>It was with sore hearts, and no little indignation, that we heard of the odious order
for this cruel separation from our beloved native regiment�a corps in which we had
all been like bairns of the same family in the bosom of our common mother�where our
officers had been more like elder brothers to us than superiors�cracking with us,
at times, in Gaelic, over all our old Hillant stories�and enjoying, as much as we
did, our Hillant songs and Hillant dances�and many of them, having known sundry individuals
among us when at home in boyhood, were as familiar and easy with us, at any ordinary
bye-hour, as you, gentlemen, are pleased to be with me at this precious moment�and
yet the di�el ae bit was our discipline any the waur o� that, whatever his Grace the
gallant Duke of Wellington may say against such a system�and, for aught I know, he
may be right enough as to the English, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb39">39</a>]</span>who have not been brought up as we were in the allowance of such liberties,�but, as
for us, when the parade hour came, or the time for duty, all such familiarities ceased,
and every one filled his own place, like the wheel of a watch, to be turned at the
will of him who was above him.�You may easily conceive, then, that banishment, or
even death itself, would have been better to us than the being thus torn from such
a regiment for the express purpose of being joined to a corps composed of Englishmen,
with whom we could neither crack of our homes, nor of our Hillant hills, nor sing
Gaelic songs, nor tell auncient stories, nor speak about Ossian, nor hear the pipes
play, nor dance the Hillant-fling.�And then, instead of the kind and brotherly correction
of our Hillant officers, the very slightest sound of whose word of reproof brought
the blush of shame into our cheeks, and was as effectual a punishment to us as if
we had been brought to the halberts�think what it was to us to be snubbed by some
cross tempered upsetting Sassenach, who could know nothing of our nation�s temper
or disposition, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb40">40</a>]</span>and who might perhaps, of a morning, order our backs to be scored, with as little
remorse as he would order a beef-steak to be brandered for his breakfast.�Oh it was
a terrible change!�Our very speerits were just altogether broken at the very thought
of it, and we actually ceased to be the same men.
</p>
<p>But, gentlemen, if this was the effect produced on our minds by the mere anticipation
of this most bitter change in our fate, what think ye was the misery of body which
we sustained, and, especially, what think ye was my misery, when I, who never wore
aught else but a kilt from the day I was born till that accursed moment, was crammed,
in spite of all I could say or do to the contrary, hip and thigh, into a pair of tight
regimental small-clothes!�Aye, you may laugh indeed gentlemen�but if anybody was to
tie your legs together with birken woodies, as they have tied the fore-legs of yon
pouny that you see feeding yonder in the bit meadow at the foot of the brae, and if
you were then to be bidden to climb up the steepest face of Ben-Machduie, you could
not be more helpless, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb41">41</a>]</span>or more ill at ease than I was. As for drilling, you might as well have set up a man
in a sack to march.
</p>
<p>�Step out!� cried they eternally��why the devil don�t you step out?�
</p>
<p>But it was just altogether ridiculous to cry out any such thing to me, for fint a
step could I take at all, unless they had letten me step out of my breeks.�I was in
perfect torture with them.�The very circulation of my blood was stopped�my nether
man was rendered entirely numb and powerless. Nay, had I been built up mid man into
a brick-wall I might have stepped out just as well.
</p>
<p>Now, I would have you to <span class="corr" id="xd29e732" title="Source: undertand">understand</span>, gentlemen, that especially and above all things, the confounded articles grippit
and pinched me most desperately over the henches. The joints of my henches were so
bound together in their very sockets by their pressure as to be rendered altogether
useless; and the torture I endured in these quarters became so great, that I felt
I could bear it no longer. I sat down, therefore, to hold a consultation with myself
what was best <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb42">42</a>]</span>to be done; and, after as cool and calm a consideration of my lamentable case as my
extreme state of misery would allow, I came, in my own private council of war, to
the determination, that I had only three things to choose from, and these were,�to
desert�to cut my throat�or to cut my breeches; and, after having much and duly weighed
these different evil alternatives, I finally resolved to adopt the last of them.
</p>
<p>Having come to this resolution, I then began, like a skilful engineer, narrowly to
examine the horrid instruments of my sufferings, in order to ascertain how and where
I could most easily make a breach in them, and one that was most likely to give the
greatest ease to myself. A little farther thought and observation soon convinced me,
that, as the parts most grievously afflicted, were those which your masters of fortification
would have called the <i>sailliant</i> angles of my henches to right and left, and especially as on these hinged much of
the motion of the whole man, it was clear that the proposed attempt to work myself
relief should be first tried in those two points. I lost not a moment, therefore,
in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb43">43</a>]</span>carrying my plan into execution. I immediately borrowed a pair of shears from a sodger�s
wife; and, sitting down regularly before my breeches, like an experienced general
about to besiege a fortress, I fairly attacked the two <i>sailliant</i> angles of the bastion, and carried them by storm; and having, with the greatest nicety,
cut out a round piece of the cloth of three or four inches in width, directly over
each hip-joint, I ventured to thrust my limbs within the very garrison of my breeches;
and really, gentlemen, the ease I obtained in consequence of this bold operation is
not to be described.
</p>
<p>So innocent was I, and so utterly unconscious of even a suspicion that I had done
any thing wrong, that when the drum beat, I went off to the private parade of the
company I had been attached to, with my heart almost as much eased as my henches;
nay, it was absolutely bounding with benevolence, and brimful with the earnest desire
and intention of spreading the blessed discovery I had made, and making it widely
known among my Hillant comrades, so that all of them who might be in the same <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb44">44</a>]</span>state of misery as I had been, might forthwith proceed to benefit themselves, as I
had done, by the bright discovery I had made. Rejoicing in my ease, therefore, I strode
across the barrack-square, with a step so much wider and grander than any I had lately
been able to use, that I felt a pride in the excellence of my invention which I cannot
possibly describe. I halted for a moment�stretched out, first my right leg, and then
my left, just as I have seen a fowl do upon its perch�and then, clapping my hand upon
the new made hole on either side of me, I chuckled for joy.
</p>
<p>�Hah!� cried I; �breeches do they call you? By my faith, then, but I have made you
more like your name by these well-imagined breaches of my own contrivance, which I
have so ingeniously opened through your accursed sides.�
</p>
<p>I then bent myself down, and made a spring into the air; after which, being quite
satisfied that a paring or two more off the edges of the round holes would make all
nearly right, I walked on with an air of dignified self-satisfaction <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb45">45</a>]</span>that was not to be mistaken. But I had not come within ten yards of the spot where
the company was falling in, when I heard the serjeant exclaim,�
</p>
<p>�My heyes! look at that ere Ighland savage! I�m damned if he arn�t been cutting big
oles in his Majesty�s rigimental breeches!�
</p>
<p>A loud horse-laugh burst out from among the men, and the serjeant joined heartily
in it. But it was no laughing matter to me; I was cut to the soul. All our horrible
anticipations of English officers, halberds, and cat-o�-nine-tails, came smack upon
me at once. I was overwhelmed�I grew dizzy�and, before I had well recovered myself,
I was marched off to the guard-house under the charge of a corporal and a file of
men, and a written crime was given in against me in these terms.
</p>
<p>�Privut Archbauld Stewart of Captin Ketley�s compnay, confined by order of Sargunt
Nevett, for aving cut two big oles in the ipps of a pair of riggimental britches belonghing
too is Magesty King George the Third.�
</p>
<p>Well, gentlemen, there was I left in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb46">46</a>]</span>guard-house for some hours a prisoner. But if I was confined in one way, I took good
care to put myself very much at my ease in another; for I pulled off my tormentors
altogether, and sat quite coolly and comfortably without them. But I was sore enough
at heart, for all that; for, independent of the fearful prospect of the unrelenting
punishment that awaited me, the disgrace of confinement to which I had thus, for the
first time in my life, been subjected, and that so unjustly, stung me to the very
heart. For a good hour or more I could do nothing but grind my teeth with absolute
vexation and rage; but at length I began to gather some command of myself, and to
think of the necessity of making up my mind as to what was to be done. I recalled
the three evil alternatives, from which I had already made that which had now proved
to be so unfortunate a selection, and as that had so miserably failed me, I continued
for sometime swinging backwards and forwards, like a bairn in a shuggy-shue,<a class="noteref" id="xd29e761src" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#xd29e761">2</a> between the two that yet remained to be tried, and I had not yet <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb47">47</a>]</span>made up my mind on the subject, when the serjeant appeared, and ordered me to put
on my breeches and follow him. I obeyed like a man who gets up from his straw to go
out and be hanged. But there was one great difference between such a poor wretch and
me, very much in his favour, for as his fetters in such a case are taken off, I was
on the contrary condemned to buckle on mine.
</p>
<p>I did follow the serjeant as he bade me, but notwithstanding the outlets I had made
in the breeches for the joints of my hench bones, and the comparative ease I had thereby
formerly enjoyed, yet the few hours I had had in the guardhouse of a freedom of limb
resembling that which I was wont to enjoy in my old kilt, made me feel so strange
upon thus recommitting my joints to the thraldom of the accursed garments, that I
went shaughling along after him, as if they had undergone no improvement at all. He
took me directly to Captain Ketley�s quarters, and whilst I was on my way thither,
I was compelled to bring my doubts to a hasty conclusion, and so I resolved that of
the two plans now only <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb48">48</a>]</span>remaining for me to choose from, desertion should be first tried, seeing that if it
should fail me, I might cut my throat afterwards, for that if I should cut my throat
first, I should not afterwards find it an easy matter to desert. I had no more time
than just enough to settle this point with myself, when the serjeant rapped at our
captain�s door.
</p>
<p>�Come in!� cried Captain Ketley, in what sounded in my ear like a tremendous voice.
</p>
<p>�Privut Archbauld Stewart and his cut breeches, your honour!� cried the serjeant,
ushering me without ceremony into the middle of the room.
</p>
<p>There I stood with my head up, and in the military attitude of attention, the which,
as you will naturally observe, gentlemen, was, of all others, out of all sight the
most convenient and best chosen attitude for me at the time; for, as you will understand,
the palms of my two hands were thus exactly applied to the two holes I had made, though
the size of the holes themselves was so great that I could by no means entirely cover
them. But if I could have done so, this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb49">49</a>]</span>well conceived man�uvre of mine would have been of no avail.
</p>
<p>�Stand at ease!� cried the serjeant, giving me at the same time a smart tap on the
back with his rattan cane.
</p>
<p>�Serjeant,� said I impatiently, �you know very well that it�s not possible for me
to stand at ease in thir fashious breeks of mine.�
</p>
<p>I saw that Captain Ketley had a hard task of it to keep his gravity.
</p>
<p>�What is this which has been reported to me of you, sir?� demanded he with as stern
a look as he could possibly assume; �how comes it that you have taken upon you to
destroy a pair of new regimental breeches in that manner?�
</p>
<p>�Captain,� said I, now quite brought to bay, and making up my mind to go through with
it, whatever the consequences might be; �Captain, if your honor will but hear me,
I will speak.�
</p>
<p>�Speak on then,� said Captain Ketley, <span class="corr" id="xd29e784" title="Not in source">�</span>provided you say nothing that as an officer I may not listen to. Serjeant Nevett,
you may retire.�
</p>
<p>�You need not fear that I shall offend you, Captain Ketley,� said I, �I have been
over long <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb50">50</a>]</span>accustomed to speak to officers to forget the respect and duty I owe to them as a
sodger, and since your honour is so kind, I will be as short as I can. I enlisted,
you see, to serve in the Inverness Highlanders, and in so doing I covenanted to fight
in company with my own countrymen, and in the freedom of a kilt. Now, against all
bargain�against all manner of justice�against my will�and against the very nature
of a Hillantman, I have been thrust, first into this English regiment, and then into
this pair of English small clothes�well may they be so called, I�m sure. Captain Ketley,
all this is most unreasonable. You might as well put a deer of the mountains into
a breachame, and expect to plough the land with him, as to put a Hillantman into such
cruel harness as thir things, with the hope that he can do his work in them; and,
although I am as wishful as any man that serves King George can be, to spend the last
drop of my blood, as some of it has flowed already in the cause of his Majesty, God
bless him! and for our common country, yet I will just tell your honour plainly and
honestly�though with all <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb51">51</a>]</span>manner of respect�that I will not stay in this Ninth Regiment to be kept in the eternal
torture of thir breeks, though I should see the men drawn out to shoot me for trying
to desert�for death itself is desirable rather than that I should longer endure such
misery as this. So I say again, that although I am quite willing to serve King George
in any regiment he may be pleased to put me into that wears the kilt, yet I will take
the first moment I can catch, to run away from such disgraceful and heartbreaking
bondage as this to which I am now subjected.�
</p>
<p>�No, no, my good fellow,� said Captain Ketley, who had all this time had his own share
of trouble in keeping himself from laughing, and who now gave way and laughed outright;
�you must not run away from us, Archy. We cannot afford to lose so good a man. We
must do all we can to put you at your ease with us. Your complaints are certainly
not altogether unreasonable. But you should not have cut holes in your breeches�you
should have come and stated your grievances to me. Remember in future, that you will
always find me ready to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb52">52</a>]</span>listen to any well-founded complaint you may have to make. Meanwhile,�see here,� said
he, taking a pair of old loose trowsers out of his chest, and tossing them to me,��wear
these for a few days, till your limbs get somewhat accustomed to the thraldom of small
clothes, and until we can get you fitted with a better and easier pair of your own.
I shall see about your immediate release from confinement, and that you and your Highland
comrades be excused from duty until you are more at home in your new clothing. If
you behave yourself well, you shall always find a friend in me.�
</p>
<p>�God bless your honour!� cried I, with a joyful and grateful heart, and, if you will
believe me, gentlemen, almost with the tears in my eyes; �your honour has spoken to
me just like one of our own kind Hillant officers of the Ninety-seventh. I�ll go all
the world over with you, though my breeks were of iron!�
</p>
<p>Well, gentlemen, Captain Ketley was as good as his word�he was a kind and steady friend
to me as long as he lived. He inquired of me whether I could read and write; and,
finding that I could <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb53">53</a>]</span>do both�aye, and spell too�and that somewhat better, as I reckon, than Serjeant Nevett,�and,
moreover, that I was not a bad hand at counting,�he got me made a corporal in less
than a fortnight, and, very soon after that, a serjeant. But, woe�s me! a few months
had hardly passed away when Captain Ketley died. Many were the salt tears I shed over
his grave, after we had given him our parting vollies, and no wonder, for he was one
of the best friends I ever had in my life. I cannot think of him, even yet, without
regret. Willingly would I have given my life for his at any time. But what is this
miserable world, gentlemen, but a valley of sorrow?
</p>
<p>Well, I got fond enough, after all, of the Holy Boys, as the old Ninth lads were called.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Clifford</span> (<i>interrupting</i>.)�How did they get that name, Archy?
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant.</span>�Oh, I�ll tell you that, sir.�You see, when they came from the West Indies, as a skeleton
regiment, they were made up again with growing boys. Colonel Campbell of Blythswood
tried to do them some good by getting them schoolmasters and Bibles. But the young
rogues <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb54">54</a>]</span>had been ill nurtured in the parent nest, and they used to barter their Bibles for
gin and gingerbread. The Duke of York used to say of them, that they were every thing
that was bad but bad sodgers�ha! ha! ha!
</p>
<p>And now, gentlemen, I believe I have little more to tell you about myself, except
that I got my jaw broken in two places by a musket ball in Holland, on the 19th of
September 1799. See what a queer kind of a mouth it has made me in the inside here.
You see I had been out superintending the working party in the redoubts, and I had
returned, tired as a dog, to the barn where the light company were quartered, and
had just laid my head on my wife�s knee to take a nap�for I was married by this time�when
a terrible thumping came to the door, and Corporal Parrot ran to see who was there.
Now, it happened that one of our serjeants was sick, and the other had been killed.�It
was Adjutant Orchard who knocked so loud.
</p>
<p>�Where is Serjeant Stewart?� demanded he, in a terrible hurry, the moment he entered
the place.
</p>
<p>�Can�t I do instead of him?� replied Corporal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb55">55</a>]</span>Parrot; �for he is just new out of the trenches.�
</p>
<p>�No!� replied the Adjutant; �if he was new out of hell, I must have him directly.�
</p>
<p>�What�s ado, sir?� demanded I, jumping up.
</p>
<p>�You know as much as I do,� replied the Adjutant; �but, depend upon it, we are not
wanted to build churches. Get you out the light bobs as fast as you can.�
</p>
<p>Well, I hurried about and got out the light company with as little delay as possible;
and no very easy matter it was to get hold of the poor fellows, knocked up as they
were. Some of them I actually pulled out of hay stacks by the legs, as you would pull
out periwinkles from their shells. The troops marched fifteen miles without a halt.
We found the French and Russians hard at it, blazing away so that we could see the
very straws at our feet as we marched over the sand. The balls came whistling about
us like hail as we advanced. First came one, and knocked away the hilt of my sword;
then came another, and cracked off the iron head of my halberd.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb56">56</a>]</span></p>
<p>�If you go on at this rate, you villains,� said I, �you�ll disarm us altogether.�
</p>
<p>Then smack came another, whack through my canteen, and spilt all my brandy.
</p>
<p>�Ye rascals!� said I, trying at the same time to save as much of it as I could in
my mouth, �that is most uncivil. Ye are no gentlemen, ye scoundrels, to spill a poor
fellow�s drop of comfort in this way.�
</p>
<p>By and bye, half-a-dozen of balls or so went through the blanket I carried on my shoulders.
</p>
<p>�By my faith,� said I, �it�s time now that I should return you my compliments for
all your civilities, you vagabonds.�
</p>
<p>I stooped to take a musket from a dead Russian for my own defence. The piece was a
rifle, and it was yet warm in his hand from the last discharge.
</p>
<p>�By your leave, my poor fellow,� said I, �I�ll borrow your firelock for a shot or
two, seeing that you have no farther use for it at this present time.�
</p>
<p>But dead as he was, the last gripe of departing life had made him hold it so fast,
that I was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb57">57</a>]</span>obliged to twist it round ere I could make him part with it. I took off his cartridge-box
by pulling the belt over his head. He had fired but two cartridges, and eighteen still
remained. I loaded and fired twice; and I was just in the act of biting off the end
of my third cartridge to fire again, when a musket ball took me in the left cheek,
and knocked me over as flat as a sixpence on the ground. The captain of the company
looked behind him, and seeing that I was still able to move my hands, he very humanely
ordered a file of men to carry me to the rear. They lifted me up from the ground,
and the whole world seemed to be going round with me. They supported me under the
arms, and I staggered along like a drunk man. They took me to a barn, where I lay
insensible for some time, until coming to myself somewhat, as I lay there, I saw two
surgeons employed with the wounded. �You will have little trouble with me, gentlemen,�
thought I within myself; �I shall be dead before you can get at me.� Just at this
moment I heard one of the surgeons say to the other,�
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb58">58</a>]</span></p>
<p>�I believe I shall die of hunger.�
</p>
<p>�I am like to faint from absolute want,� said the other.
</p>
<p>I could not speak, but I beckoned.
</p>
<p>�By and bye,� said one of the surgeons, shaking his head.
</p>
<p>�Your turn is not come yet,� said the other.
</p>
<p>I beckoned again, and pointed to the wallet at my side.
</p>
<p>�Oh ho!� said the first surgeon crossing the place, and rapidly followed by the other,��Oh
ho!<a id="xd29e849"></a> I comprehend you now. Let�s see what you have got in your larder.�
</p>
<p>He put his hand into the wallet, and found some balls of oatmeal, which my wife, honest
woman, had made by rolling them up with water, and then giving them a roast among
the ashes. The two gentlemen devoured them with great glee. They then looked at my
chafts, put some lint into the wound, and bound it up.
</p>
<p>�Well,� thought I to myself, �a leaden ball made the wound, and a ball of oatmeal
has doctored it. Many thanks to my worthy wife, God bless her!�
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb59">59</a>]</span></p>
<p>After the doctors left us, the place, which was pitch dark, became hot and pestiferous,
and the groans that came from some of the poor wretches put me in mind of pandemonium.
I was for some time feverish and restless. I tried to stretch myself out at length,
but I felt some one at my feet who would not stir all I could do. Though I could not
speak, I was not sparing of my kicks, but still the person regarded me not. Next to
me was Serjeant Wilson with a broken leg, and he was pressed upon by some one at his
side. But the Serjeant had the full use of his tongue.
</p>
<p>�Sir,� said he to his neighbour, for he was noted for being a very polite man, �will
you do me the favour to lie a little farther over, and take your elbow out of my stomach.�
</p>
<p>His civil request was disregarded, and there was no reply.
</p>
<p>�Oh!� said the serjeant, �perhaps the gentleman is a furreiner; but all them furreiners
understands French, so I�ll try my hand at that with him:�Moushee wooly wous have
the goodness to takee your elbow out of my guts. Confound the fellow, what an edification
he has had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb60">60</a>]</span>that he does not understand French. I�ve heard Ensign Flitterkin say that it is the
language of Europe. Pray, sir, may I ax if you be a European? No answer,�by my soul
then I may make bold to say that you are any thing but a civilian. Sir,� continued
the serjeant, beginning now to lose patience altogether, and to wax very wroth, �I
insist on your removing your elbow. I say, rascal! take your elbow out of my stomach
this moment!�
</p>
<p>And so the serjeant went on from bad to worse, till he swore, and went on to swear,
at the poor man more and more bloodily the whole night. But neither his swearing,
nor my kicking, could rid either of us of our troublesome companions. And it was no
great wonder indeed�for when the day-light came, we discovered that they were two
dead Russians!
</p>
<p>�This is a horrible place!� exclaimed the principal surgeon when he came back in the
morning. �As near as I can guess, one hundred and fifty-two men have died in this
wretched barn since last night!�we must have the wounded out of this.�
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb61">61</a>]</span></p>
<p>Thanks to my wife�s oatmeal balls, which the grateful surgeons had not forgotten,
my wounds were dressed the very first man. We were soon afterwards carried on hand-barrows
by a Russian party down to the flat-bottomed boats, and so we were conveyed to the
Texel. I bore the bullet home in my chafts, and it was cut out by an English doctor
in Deal hospital. I was discharged on the 23d of June 1800. But my pension was granted
before pensions were so big as they are now-a-days, so that I am but ill off compared
to some who have come home from the late wars. But, thank God, I am contented, since
I cannot make a better of it.

<h2 class="main">GALLANTRY OF THE SEVENTY-FIRST HIGHLAND LIGHT INFANTRY.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Clifford.�How little known are the miseries to which the brave defenders of Britain�s
glory are subjected!�and how meagre is their reward, and how poor is their harvest
of individual fame!�Our Nelsons and our Wellingtons, to be sure, are as certainly,
as they are deservedly, destined to immortality of name. But is it not most painful
to think that so many of our bravest hearts have gallantly fallen, to sleep in undistinguished
oblivion? Your scene in the old barn, Serjeant, reminds me of an anecdote which I
had from an officer of the Ninety-first Regiment.�It has never yet appeared in print,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb63">63</a>]</span>though it well deserves to be so recorded, as being worthy of that distinguished corps,
the Seventy-first Highland Light Infantry, to which it belongs.
</p>
<p>The circumstances took place in 1813, during the Peninsular War. The Seventy-first
were at that time stationed with the Fiftieth and the Ninety-second, at St. Pierre,
on the main road between Bayonne and St. Jean-pied-de-Port.�This was the key of Lord
Hill�s position on the <span class="corr" id="xd29e878" title="Source: rivers">river</span> Adour, and the fire of musquetry brought against its defenders on the 13th December,
was such as the oldest veterans had never before witnessed. The corps under Lord Hill,
indeed, were on that day attacked by Soult�s whole force. But so nobly did those fine
regiments perform their duty, that the late Lieutenant-General the Honourable William
Stewart, next day gave out an order, which I remember treasuring up in my memory as
a masterpiece of soldier-like diction. I think the very words were these:��The second
Division has greatly distinguished itself, and its gallantry in yesterday�s action
is fully felt by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb64">64</a>]</span>the Commander of the Forces, and the Allied Army.�
</p>
<p>And well indeed had they merited this highly creditable testimonial of their good
behaviour. But the carnage was great, and there were many who, alas! did not survive
to participate in the honour conferred by it. Several of the wounded, belonging to
the respective corps, were huddled together in the lower storey of an old house, that
stood upon the very ground on which the thickest part of the contest had taken place.
Now it happened, that certain officers from different regiments had taken shelter
in a room in the floor above, where they were refreshing themselves, after their fatigue,
with such food and other restoratives as they could command, and among them was that
officer of the Ninety-first who told me the facts to which he was an ear-witness.
</p>
<p>The conversation of these gentlemen, though mingled now and then with many regrets
for lost companions, had a certain temperate joy in it�a joy arising from a conviction
that they had behaved like men�and which was tempered by strong feelings of gratitude
to a kind Providence, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb65">65</a>]</span>who had preserved them amidst all the perils of the fight. Suddenly their talk was
put an end to by the most heart-rending groans and shrieks of agony, that came up
from the room below, through the old decayed floor. What mirth or joy there was among
them, was altogether banished by the frequency and intensity of the screams, that
betokened the mortal sufferings of a dying man. They sat for a time mutely, though
deeply sympathizing, with the poor unfortunate from whom they came. At length they
distinctly heard another faint, and apparently expiring voice, say, in a tone of rebuke,��Haud
your tongue, James, and bear your fate like a man. We�ll soon be baith at ease.�But,
in the mean time, haud your tongue, for there are folk aboon us that may be hearin�
you; and if you have no respect for yoursell, recollect what you owe to the gallant
Seventy-first Hillant Light Infantry, to which we baith belong.�
</p>
<p>This appeal had the desired effect. All that could now be heard, in the stillness
of the night, was a low murmur. A surgeon, who was of the party, immediately went
to administer what relief <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb66">66</a>]</span>he might to the wretched sufferers. But in one short hour these heroic men had ceased
to exist, and no one can now tell even the name of either of them.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Author.</span>�A most touching anecdote!�What magnanimous fellows!
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Grant.</span>�Their names should have been written by the hand of Fame herself, in letters of the
purest and most imperishable gold!�Yet they have been allowed to sink into the sea
of forgetfulness, and,
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">�Like the snow-falls in the river,
</p>
<p class="line">A moment white, then gone for ever.�</p>
</div>
<p class="first">they have melted into oblivion�so far, at least, as this world is concerned.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Clifford.</span>�Yes; they sleep unremembered, whilst every lily-livered cobler, or tailor, who has
handled his awl, or his bodkin, with no more peril to his person than may have lain
on the point of one or other of these formidable weapons, has his tombstone�his death�s
head and cross-bones�and his attendant cherubims�as well as his text and his epitaph.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant.</span>�Very true, sir�very true. What <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb67">67</a>]</span>have such chields as these to do with fame? But for all that, we see fame arise to
the silliest men, and from the most trifling causes.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Grant.</span>�Right, Archy. For instance, I remember a certain Highlander, who gained his fame
in a way that may perhaps make you envious�for it is the tale of your unwhisperables
that has brought him to my mind.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant.</span>�Aye, sir!�What was his story?
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Grant.</span>�Why, the hero was a certain Rory Maccraw, who, despising the kilt which he had worn
all his life, resolved, at all risks, to figure in a pair of those elegant emblems
of civilization called breeches. At the present day, one may travel from the Tweed
to the Pentland Firth without seeing such a thing as a kilt; but at the time of which
I am now speaking, anything in the shape of breeches was just as rarely to be seen
as the kilt is now. Rory had a pair made for him in some distant town, where, as they
would say in Ireland, he had not been by when his measure was taken, and having put
them on, he left his glen to go to a market. It was observed by his neighbours, that
he never <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb68">68</a>]</span>before took so long a time to walk the same distance, and, from his strange and stately
manner of strutting, they attributed this circumstance to the pride he felt in his
new garments. Arrived at the market, the expectation he had indulged in, that he was
to excite the wonder and envy of all the people there, did not deceive him. He was
followed, and stared at, and admired, and questioned wherever he went. If a dancing
bear had waddled through the fair, he could not have had half the number of people
after him. But like most of those who envy the lot of their neighbours, these good
folks only saw the outside of things, and knew not the misery which was covered by
this fair external show. In the midst of their admiration, poor Rory was in torture.
He would have given all he was worth, unmentionables and all, to have got rid of the
admiring crowds that followed him; and at last, long before he had done half his business
in the market�for as to pleasure, he could taste none of it�he, the envied, the observed
of all observers, watched his opportunity to steal hobbling away down a back lane,
whence he went limping in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb69">69</a>]</span>agony into the country. There, seating himself by the public way-side, regardless
of what eyes might behold him, he pulled off the instruments of his suffering, and
hanging them on the end of his staff, he placed it over his shoulder, and so trudged
his way homeward, in defiance of the taunts, gibes, and laughter of the crowds which
he fell in with by the way. But his fame was established; and ever afterwards he went
by the name of Peter Breeks.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Clifford.</span>�Capital!
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Author.</span>�Well, Archy, to return to your own story, and the disappointment you have met with
in the arrestment of your career of glory, I would fain comfort you with the old proverb,
that a contented mind is better than riches.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant.</span>�That is very true, sir; and I am very thankful that I am blessed with that same.
And although I got but little in the army but hard knocks, yet I would take them all
over again, rather than that I should not have seen the many things I did see, as
well as the heaps of queer human beings I met with during the few years I served.
What is man, gentlemen, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb70">70</a>]</span>unless he gets the rust of home, and the reek of his own fire-side rubbed off him
by travel? He can never be expected to speculate on any thing but the ducks in the
dubbs, or the hens on the midden-head. Though I had a tolerable education for the
like of me, what would I have been had I never been out of this valley? Not much better,
I trow, than one of the stirks that are bred in it. Bless you, sirs, I saw a vast
of human nature in my travels.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Grant.</span>�And thought much and well on it too, Archy, if I mistake not.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant.</span>�May be I did, sir,�and a very curious nature it is, I�ll assure you. But, gentlemen,
we must cross the water at this wooden bridge here.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Author.</span>�If you had not seen so much by going into the world as you have done, Archy, I have
great doubts whether that curiosity, which has since made you pick up that great store
of your native legends which you are said to possess, might not have lain entirely
dormant.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant.</span>�Oh, bless your honour, I should never have thought of such things. It was the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb71">71</a>]</span>seeing so much that roused up the spirit of enquiry within me. And so it happened,
that after I came back from the sodgering trade, this spirit could not rest till I
had gathered up all the curious stories I could get. And then I fell tooth and nail
upon books, so that, when I was not working, I was always reading histories, <i>novelles</i>, magazines, newspapers, and such like, so that I am not just altogether that ill
informed. But stop a moment, gentlemen; do you see yon bright green spot in the hollow
of the hill-side yonder above us?
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Grant.</span>�Yes; but what is there wonderful about that, Archy?
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant.</span>�There is nothing very wonderful about itself, indeed, but it is worth your remarking
for all that. It is what we call in this country a <i>wallee</i>, that is, the quaking bog out of which a spring wells forth.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Clifford.</span>�Tut, Archy! There are few grouse shooters who have not experienced the treachery
of these smooth-faced, flattering, but most deceitful water-traps.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant.</span>�Smooth-faced, flattering, and deceitful, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb72">72</a>]</span>indeed, sir. I�ve heard them compared by some to the fair sex, beauteous and smiling
outside, and cruelly cold-hearted within. But I think any such comparison is most
unjust, for my old woman never deceived me; and, as I have told you, if it had not
been for her oatmeal balls I verily believe I should not have been here at this moment.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Clifford.</span>�It would ill become you, indeed, to slander the fair sex, Mister Serjeant, and depend
upon it, you will not catch me doing so.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant.</span>�But about the wallee yonder; I was saying��
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Clifford.</span>�Aye, the wallee; I shall never forget the first cold-bath I had up to the neck in
one of them. It was all owing to the spite of a cunning old moorcock, which I had
severely wounded. Out of revenge, I suppose, for the mortal injury I had done him,
he chose to come fluttering down into the very middle of what I conceived to be a
beautiful surface of hard green-sward. Being but a young sportsman at the time, and
very eager to secure my bird, who sat most provokingly <i>tock-tock-tocking</i> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb73">73</a>]</span>at me, as if he had bid me defiance, I ran down the bank, and made a bound towards
him. In I went souse. I shiver yet to think of it�my very senses were congealed�and
for a moment I verily believed that I had been suddenly transformed into the North
Pole, and that the cock-grouse that fluttered around me was Captain Parry come to
explore me. And, i� faith, if it had not been for the light foot and strong arm of
the gilly who was with me, I believe I might have been sticking upright there, preserved
in ice till this moment. There was a <i>moorish</i> bath for you!
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant.</span>�They are most unchancy bits for strangers; that is certain, sir.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Clifford.</span>�Unchancy indeed! But if that is all you have to tell us about yonder place in the
hill-side, Mr. Archy, you may save yourself the trouble of attempting to astonish
me with your information; for, Sassenach though I be, I promise you that I have been
long ago initiated into the full depth of the mystery.�Nymphs and Naiads of the crystal
Aven, what a beautiful stream there is for fishing!
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb74">74</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant.</span>��Tis very good, indeed, sir. But yon wallee that I was speaking about would swallow
a horse, with you on the top of it. Many a time have I thrust a long pole down into
it without reaching any thing the least like firm ground. It would swallow that fishing-wand
of yours, sir.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Clifford.</span>�(<i>Already employed in putting his rod together.</i>)�Plague choke it, I should be sorry indeed to see my rod go in any such way. It is
one of the best Bond ever made; and though adapted, by means of these different pieces,
to any size of stream, it was never intended for such deep sea fishing as you would
put it to. I shall apply it to another purpose, my good serjeant. With this sky, the
trouts there will take a grey mallard�s wing with a yellow silk body, in great style.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant.</span>�But the wallee up yonder is worth your notice, because of an ould auncient monumental
stone, that once stood on the dry bank beside it.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Grant.</span>�Ha! a monumental stone!�let us hear about that.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb75">75</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant.</span>�It was about seven feet high, sir, and the tradition regarding it is, that it was
set up there in memory of a sad story that is connected with it.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Author.</span>�A story, said you?
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Clifford.</span>�Then, my good fellow, Serjeant Stewart, just have the kindness to sit down there,
and tell us the particulars of your sad story, while I give a few casts here over
this most tempting stream.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant.</span>�With all manner of pleasure, sir; I shall be happy to tell your honours all I have
gathered about it. It is the very legend for which Mr. Clifford marked me down in
his book.
</p>
<p>Clifford immediately began to fish. Grant and I seated ourselves on the daisied bank
of the river, one on each side of the serjeant. The gilly stretched himself at length
on the grass, and was soon asleep�the pony with the panniers grazed as far around
him as the length of his halter would let him, and my Newfoundland dog Bronte sat
watching the trouts leaping, whilst Archy proceeded with his narrative, as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb76">76</a>]</span>nearly as I can recollect, in the following words; but if not always precisely in
the serjeant�s own language, at least I shall give it with a strict adherence to his
facts.

<h2 class="main">LEGEND OF THE CLAN-ALLAN STEWARTS.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">From the important correction which your honour has made upon my genealogy, I think
I may now venture to say, with some confidence, that the time of my legend must be
somewhere about the fifteenth century�how early in it I cannot say; but it is pretty
clear that my ancestor, Sir Allan Stewart, must have lived about that period. As I
have already told you, the whole of this country, hill and glen, was then covered
with forests, except in such spots as were kept open by the art of man for pasture
or for tillage, but of the latter, even of the rudest kind, I suspect there was but
little hereaway in those days. I take it for granted that the chief of the Clan-Allan
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb78">78</a>]</span>must have had his stronghold at the old tower of Drummin, though I do not mean to
say that it was identically the same building that now exists there. It stands, as
some of you perhaps know, gentlemen, a good way down the country from where we now
are, on a point of table land considerably elevated above the valley, which is there
rendered wider by the junction of the river Livat with the river Aven, and just in
the angle between these two streams. When the noble old forests waved over the surrounding
hills, leaving the quiet meadows below open in rich pasture, it must have been even
yet a more beautiful place for man to dwell in than it is now,�and, let me tell you,
that is saying a great deal.
</p>
<p>My history begins towards the end of the life of Sir Allan Stewart, whose term of
existence had been long, and no doubt boisterous enough, as you may very well guess.
He was by this time so old as to be confined to his big oak chair, which was generally
placed for him under the projection of the huge chimney of the ancient fire-place,
or <i>lumm</i>, as we call it in Scotland; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb79">79</a>]</span>and there he sat, propped up with pillows, crooning over old ballads, and muttering
old saws from morn till night, as if he now cared for nothing in this life, but to
drone away the last dull measure of his time, like the end of some drowsy ill-composed
pibroch, if such a thing there can be. But the lively interest which he took when
any stirring event occurred, which in any degree affected the honour or welfare of
himself, his family or clan, sufficiently showed that all his martial fire was not
extinguished; for then would it flash out from beneath his heavy eyelids�his bulky
form would move impatiently on his seat, and he would turn his eyes restlessly towards
his broadsword and targe, that hung conspicuously among the deers� heads, wolfs� skins,
and the numerous warlike weapons that covered the walls, with an expression so animated,
as very plainly to speak the ardour of his decaying spirit, which still, like that
of the old war-horse, seemed thus to snuff up the battle from afar.
</p>
<p>Sir Allan had two tall strapping sons by his first marriage�Walter and Patrick, both
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb80">80</a>]</span>them pretty men. To Walter, as the elder of the two, he looked as his successor, and,
accordingly, he already acted in all things, and on all occasions, as his father�s
representative. After the death of their mother, Sir Allan had married a woman of
lower degree, by whom he had a third son, called Murdoch, whose naturally bad dispositions
had been fostered by the doting fondness of his old father. Murdoch�s mother, at the
time we are speaking of, was what we would call in our country phrase a handsome boardly-looking
dame, of some forty years of age or so, whose smooth tongue and deceitful smile covered
the blackest and most depraved heart.
</p>
<p>�See, father!� said Walter Stewart to old Sir Allan, as he and his brother Patrick
entered the hall one evening, followed by some of their people, with whom they had
been all day engaged in the pursuit of a wolf, whose grinning countenance, attached
to his shaggy skin, was borne triumphantly on the point of a hunting spear. �See here,
father! we have got him at last. We have at last taken vengeance on the villain for
his cruel slaughter of poor Isabel�s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb81">81</a>]</span>child. Look at the spoils of the murdering caitiff who devoured the little innocent.�
</p>
<p>�Hath he not been a fell beast, father?� said Patrick, holding up the hunting spear
before Sir Allan, and shaking the trophy.
</p>
<p>�Ah!� said Sir Allan, rousing himself up, �a fell beast indeed!�aye, aye�poor child,
poor child!�bring his head nearer to me, boy! Would I could have been with you! Aye,
aye�dear me�age will come upon us. But I have seen the day, boys�aye, aye�och, hey!�
</p>
<p>�Ho, there!� cried Walter Stewart, �what means it that there are no signs of supper?
By St. Hubert, but we have toiled long enough and hard enough to-day with legs, arms,
spears, spades, and mattocks, to have well earned our meal! Where is brother Murdoch?�where
is the Lady Stradawn?�
</p>
<p>�Aye, aye,� said the querulous old Sir Allan, �it is ever thus now-a-days. I am always
left to myself�weary, weary is my life I am sure�and I am hungry�very hungry. Aye,
aye.�
</p>
<p>�Thou shalt have thy supper very soon, father,� said Patrick, kindly taking his hand;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb82">82</a>]</span>�and Walter and I will leave you but for a brief space, to rid us of these wet and
soiled garments.�
</p>
<p>The two brothers then hastened from the hall to go to their respective chambers.
</p>
<p>�Whose draggle-tailed beast was that I saw tied up under the tree beyond the outer
gateway as we came in?� demanded Walter of his attendant, Dugald Roy.
</p>
<p>�I have seen the beast before,� replied Dugald. �If I am not far mista�en, it is the
garron the proud Priest of Dalestie rides,�and a clever beast it would need to be,
I am sure, for many a long, and late, and queer gate does it carry him, I trow.�
</p>
<p>�How came the animal there, Dugald?� demanded Walter quickly.
</p>
<p>�If by your question, <i>how</i> the animal came there, you would ask what road he took, Sir Knight,� replied Dugald,
�I must tell you that the man that could answer you would need to deal with the devil,
for no one but the foul fiend himself could follow the Priest of Dalestie; for, unless
he be most wickedly belied, his ways follow <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb83">83</a>]</span>those of the Evil One, as much as our good father, Peter of Dounan, is known to travel
in the path of his blessed Master.�
</p>
<p>�Nay, but I would know from thee, in plain terms, where thou judgest that the rider
of the horse may be?� said Sir Walter, impatiently.
</p>
<p>�With your lady mother, the Lady Stradawn, I reckon,� said Dugald, sinking his voice
to a half whisper.
</p>
<p>�Call her not my lady mother!� said Sir Walter, angrily, �my lady step-mother, if
thou wilt, or my step-mother without the lady, for that, in truth, would better befit
her, disgrace as she hath been and still is to us all.�Here, undo this buckle!�But
what, I pr�ythee, hath she to do with the proud Priest of Dalestie, as thou hast so
well named him?�
</p>
<p>�Nay, nothing that I know of, Sir Walter, unless it be to confess her,� replied Dugald.
</p>
<p>�Why, the good old father, Peter of Dounan, was here but yesterday, was he not?� exclaimed
Sir Walter, �might he not have shriven her?�
</p>
<p>�Father Peter was here sure enough,� replied <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb84">84</a>]</span>Dugald, �but it would seem that he is not to the lady�s fancy.�
</p>
<p>�Beshrew her fancy!� cried Sir Walter, bitterly,��Where could she, or any one, find
a worthier confessor than Father Peter of Dounan? He is, indeed, a good and godly
man, and, frail as he is in body, we know that he is always ready to run, as fast
as his feeble limbs can carry him, wherever his pious duties or his charities may
call him.�Moreover, he is at all times within reach, what need, then, hath she to
send so far a-field for one whose character is, by every one�s report, so very questionable�give
me my hose and sandals, Donald.�Now thou may�st go.�By the Rood, I like not that pestilent
and ill-famed fellow coming about our house! He hath more character for arrogance,
and self-indulgence as a glutton and a toss-pot, than for sanctity.�It was an ill
day for this country side when it was disgraced by his coming into it.�
</p>
<p>After muttering this last sentence to himself, Walter quickly descended the narrow
stair, and approached the door of the lady�s bower in another <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb85">85</a>]</span>part of the building.�It was partially open.�He tapped gently, and, no answer being
returned, he pushed it up, and great were his surprise and disgust at the scene which
he beheld. The Lady Stradawn was sitting, or rather reclining in her arm-chair, with
a pretty large round table before her, covered with good things.�A huge venison pasty
occupied the centre of it, and around it stood several dishes, in no very regular
order, containing different dainties. Two well-used trenchers, showed that some one
else had assisted her, in producing the havoc that appeared to have been wrought in
the pie, and among the other viands�and a black-jack half full of ale�and a tall silver
stoup, which, though now empty, still gave forth a potent odour of the spiced wine
which it had contained�together with two mazers of the same metal, which bore the
marks of having been used in the drinking of it, proved that the guest, who had just
left the lady, must have been a noble auxiliary in this revel, which, judging from
the fact of an over-turned drinking horn that lay on the floor, and one or two <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb86">86</a>]</span>other circumstances that appeared, must have been a merry one. The deep sleep in which
the lady lay, and her flushed countenance, left no doubt in Sir Walter�s mind that
she had enjoyed a full share of this private banquet. By the time he had leisure to
make himself fully aware of all these particulars, the lady�s bower-woman appeared
at the chamber door. She started, and would have retreated�but Sir Walter seized her
by the wrist, and adroitly put a question to her before she had time to recover from
her confusion.
</p>
<p>�When did the priest of Dalestie go forth from hence, Jessy?� demanded he.
</p>
<p>�I have just come from seeing him to horse, Sir Knight,� said the woman, trembling.
</p>
<p>�Well, Jessy, thou mayest go; I would speak with thy mistress in private,� said Sir
Walter, seeing her out, and shutting the chamber door; and then, turning to the Lady
Stradawn, and shaking her arm till he had awakened her. �Madam,� said he, �what unseemly
sight is this?�
</p>
<p>�Sis�sis�sis�sight, Sir Priest?� replied <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb87">87</a>]</span>the lady, with her eyes goggling; �sis�sight! What mean ye, Sir Priest? he! he! he!�
</p>
<p>�Holy Saint Andrew grant me temper!� said Sir Walter. �Madam, Sir Allan waits for
thee to give him his evening meal: he is impatient. Sir Allan, I say!�
</p>
<p>�Tut! hang Sir Allan,� cried the lady, still unconscious as to whom she was addressing,
and taking him by the arm; �hang Sir Allan, as thou thyself saidst but now, thou most
merry conditioned mettlesome, Sir Priest. He! he! he! Hang the old stobber-chops,
and let�s be jolly while we can. Come; sit down�sit down, I say. You need not go yet.
Did I not tell thee that Jessy keeps the door?�
</p>
<p>�I am not the priest, vile woman!� cried Sir Walter, with indignation, whilst, at
the same time, he shook her off with a force and rudeness that seemed almost to bring
her back to her senses. �Did�st thou not now, alas! alas! to our shame, most unworthily
fill that place once occupied by my sainted mother, and that thine exposure would
prove but the greater dishonour to our house, by the holy Rood, I would call up <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb88">88</a>]</span>every thing that hath life within these walls, down to the very cat, that all eyes
might behold thy disgrace, and then should�st thou be trundled forth, and rolled into
the river, that the fishes might gorge themselves on thine obscene carcase!�
</p>
<p>Bursting from the apartment, Walter hastily sought the hall; and the evening meal
having been by this time spread, he called to the retainers to be seated, and hastened
to busy himself in attending to his father, in supplying him with the food prepared
for him, and with such little matters as he knew the old man most liked�feeding him
from time to time like a child.
</p>
<p>�Aye, aye, that�s good,� said old Sir Walter. �Thanks, thanks, my boy; you are a good
boy. But where is Bella? where is the Lady Stradawn? Och hey, that�s good,�but she
is often away now; seldom it is, I am sure, that I see her. Aye, aye, Walter, boy,
that is good�that is very good.�
</p>
<p>When his father was satisfied, Walter seated himself at the board, and ate and drank
largely, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb89">89</a>]</span>from very vexation and ire, and in order to keep down the storm of rage which was
secretly working within him. This, as well as the cause of it, he privately determined
to conceal, even from his brother Patrick, with whom he had been, upon all other occasions,
accustomed to share his inmost thoughts. For the rest of the night he sat gloomy and
abstracted, and at an earlier hour than usual he hurried off to his chamber. There,
having summoned his attendant, Dugald Roy, he questioned him more particularly as
to all he knew regarding the visits of the Priest of Dalestie to Drummin, and having
then dismissed him, with strict injunctions to maintain a prudent silence, he threw
himself into bed, to pass a restless and perturbed night.
</p>
<p>The next morning saw the Lady Stradawn glide into the hall, to preside over the morning
meal, gaily dressed, and covered as usual with chains, brooches, and rings of massive
worth, which she procured no one knew how. Her countenance beamed with her wonted
smiles, as if nothing wrong had happened, or could have happened on her part. Walter
and Patrick saluted <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb90">90</a>]</span>her with that cold yet civil deference, which they had always been in the habit of
using towards her, as the wife of their father, and in which Walter took care that
neither his brother, nor any one else, should perceive any shadow of change upon the
present occasion. The manner of her salutation was as blythe, kind, free, and unconcerned
as it ever was before.
</p>
<p>�Wicked rogue, Walter, that thou art!� said she in a tone of merry railery, �fie for
shame on thee! to steal into thy lady mother�s bower to catch her asleep in her arm-chair!
In sooth I was not altogether well last night, else had I joined thee at the festive
board, to rejoice with thee over the spoils of that grim gaffer wolf, whom they tell
me thou hast so nobly slain.�
</p>
<p>�Thou did�st indeed seem somewhat indisposed, madam,� said Sir Walter with a peculiarly
significant emphasis, and with a penetrating look which she alone could understand.
</p>
<p>�I was very much indisposed as you say, Walter,� replied she, as if quite unconscious
that he had intended to convey to her any covered meaning; �that foolish old woman,
Nancy, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb91">91</a>]</span>the miller�s wife, took it into her wise head to come a plaguing me, to reckon with
her about the kain fowls she had paid into the castle since last quarter-day; and
she talks�Holy Virgin, how the woman does talk!�
</p>
<p>�Truly the woman does talk marvellously,� replied Walter, biting his nether lip to
keep down his vexation.
</p>
<p>�As thou say�st, son Walter, she does e�en talk most marvellously. Her tongue seems
to have learned the art of wagging from the clapper of old John�s mill. I protest
I would as lieve sit listening to the one as to the other. My head aches still with
the noise of her clatter.�
</p>
<p>�I wonder not indeed that thy head should ache,� replied Sir Walter.
</p>
<p>�And then, forsooth, I behoved to call up meat for the greedy cummer,� continued the
lady,��Holy Mother, how the woman did swallow the eatables and drinkables!�
</p>
<p>�She must have swallowed enough of both sorts,� said Sir Walter, with a meaning in
his mode of speaking, that he began to suspect he might have made almost too plainly
marked; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb92">92</a>]</span>and, hastening to change the subject, �Madam,� continued he, �I fear you have forgotten
Sir Allan this morning.�
</p>
<p>�Holy Saints, but so I have!� cried she, starting up from her seat,��what have I been
thinking of? My poor Sir Allan!� continued she, as she hastened to him with a covered
silver dish, that contained the minced food the old man was wont to take; and, after
making of him, with all the fuss and phrase she would have used to an infant, she
put a napkin around his neck, and proceeded to feed him.
</p>
<p>�Where is Murdoch this morning?� demanded Patrick of his brother.
</p>
<p>�I know not,� replied Walter, as he sat musing with a clouded brow.
</p>
<p>�He was not at supper last night,� observed Patrick again; <span class="corr" id="xd29e1154" title="Not in source">�</span>nay, I know not that I have seen him for these three days bypast.�
</p>
<p>�He was not at supper,� said Sir Walter, still absorbed by his own thoughts.
</p>
<p>�Murdoch is an idle good-for-nothing,� said the Lady Stradawn, joining in the conversation,
from the place where she stood by the side of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb93">93</a>]</span>Sir Allan�s chair. �Though he be mine own son, I will say that for him, that it would
be well for him to take a pattern by his elder brothers, and be killing wolves, or
doing some such useful work, and not be staying out whole days and nights this way,
at weddings and merry-makings, without ever showing us his face. I wish you would
give him a good word of your brotherly advice, my dear son Walter.�
</p>
<p>�Chut!�tut!� cried old Sir Allan,��let the boy alone!�aye, aye�let the boy alone.
The lad is young.�I was a wild slip myself once in a day�that I was. But old age will
creep on�hech sirs!�aye, aye�what days I have seen!�Och, hey!�
</p>
<p>�Here, take this, my dear Sir Allan,� said the lady,��take this, dearest��tis the
last spoonful.�
</p>
<p>�Where art thou going, brother?� said Patrick, rising to follow his brother Sir Walter,
who had left the table, and was moving towards the door.
</p>
<p>�Up the glen to look for a deer,� replied Walter.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb94">94</a>]</span></p>
<p>�Then have with thee brother,� said Patrick.
</p>
<p>Sir Walter would have fain shaken himself free from his brother, for that morning
at least; but he felt that he could not do so without a certain appearance of unkindness,
which the warm affection that subsisted between them could not allow him to use, or
that otherwise, he must have given him an explanation, which he was conscious that
he could not have given him, consistently with those designs which he then privately
cherished in his bosom. He was therefore compelled silently to assent to his accompanying
him. They both accordingly assumed that humble garb, which they usually wore when
bent upon the pursuit of the deer,�in which, but for their carriage and bearing, they
might easily have been mistaken for the humblest of their party, and, after such preparation,
they sallied forth.
</p>
<p>They were hardly gone, when the Lady Stradawn, leaving the old Sir Allan to entertain
himself with his own dreamy musings and vacant thoughts, climbed to the bartizan of
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb95">95</a>]</span>tower to look out for her son, Murdoch. It was yet early in the morning�but as her
two step-sons had a walk of a good many miles before them, ere they could reach the
place where they proposed hunting, they and their people were seen toiling up the
valley, at a pace which corresponded with the violence of those feelings which then
possessed Sir Walter, who was stretching away at the head of the party.
</p>
<p>�Curses on ye both!� cried the lady, with intense bitterness, after having followed
them with her malignant eyes, till they had wound out of sight behind a projecting
spur of a wooded mountain that flanked the valley.��Curses!�black and withering curses
on ye both, vile spawn that ye are, that stand between my boy and his prospects!�I
fear that Walter�my especial curse upon him!�for, with all his fair words, he is stern
and ferocious as a wild cat when he is roused.�But, wild cat though he be, the wily
viper may yet wind its folds silently around him, and sting him to the death ere he
may have time to unglove his claws.�What <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb96">96</a>]</span>can make my darling boy tarry so long.�He has now been absent for more than three
days.�Much as he hath enriched me with money and jewels, I like not the risk he runs.�But
he will not be forbidden.�Nature works in him, and perhaps it is as well that he should
thus render himself hardy, seeing that he must one day�aye, and that soon too, if
I have any cunning left in me�command the proud Clan-Allan. Stay, did I not see tartans
yonder, and arms glittering in yon farther lawnde, in the vale below, beyond those
nearer woods? That must surely be Murdoch and his men. The foolish boy will not surely
bring them within nearer ken of the Castle? Ha!�I see one figure separate from the
rest, whilst the main body seems to take to the woods on the hill-side. In sooth,
there is no prudence lacking in the youth, nay, nor any cunning neither, as I well
know, from the trouble it hath cost me to lull his suspicions regarding the Priest
of Dalestie. But if Murdoch hath cunning, he hath it from me, his mother; and it will
be hard indeed if mine cannot match it. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb97">97</a>]</span>Ah!�there he already bursts from the wood�I must hasten to meet him in my bower, that
I may learn what luck he hath had.�
</p>
<p>The lady hurried down to her bower�quickly found some errand on which to despatch
her woman�and then she sat waiting impatiently, turning over the bunch of antique
keys which hung at her girdle, until she heard her son�s step in the passage, and
his gentle tap at her door.
</p>
<p>�Come in!� said the Lady Stradawn in a subdued voice��come in, my son!�
</p>
<p>�Ha!�I am glad that thou art here and alone, mother,� said Murdoch, a slim, handsome,
dark-eyed youth, who, after cautiously entering, shut the door behind him, and carefully
turned the huge key that locked it. �I am glad that you are here alone, for I have
such treasure for you.�
</p>
<p>�Hush, hush, my darling,� said the lady, almost in a whisper��speak lower, I entreat
you, lest any eaves-dropper should hear you.�Quick!�how sped ye?�and what have you
got?�
</p>
<p>�We have been all the way to Banff again <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb98">98</a>]</span>this time,� replied Murdoch. �Seeing that we sped so well the last time we made thither,
as thou well knowest we did, we thought we should try our luck there once more. We
heard that there was a market in the Brugh, and we sent a clever-witted spy among
the packmen, to gather who among them might be best worth holding talk with. Two of
them we learned were to travel together for company�s sake,�fellows who dealt in goldsmiths�
work. But, marry! they travelled not far from the town-end till we met them, when,
like good-natured civil fellows, we eased them of their heavy loads, under which they
seemed to sweat so grievously; and that they might not trouble us here, and at the
same time being loth to part two such friends, we set them both a travelling together
on a journey to the next world.�
</p>
<p>�Speak not of the next world, Murdoch!� said the lady, shuddering. �But they were
sickerly sent thither, said�st thou?�
</p>
<p>�As surely as we shall one day go there ourselves, good mother,� replied Murdoch.
</p>
<p>�Speak not of our going there, boy,� said the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb99">99</a>]</span>lady. ��Tis time enough yet. But there is little crime I wot, after all, in ridding
this world of such cheating gangerels as those you tell me of.�
</p>
<p>�Crime!� replied Murdoch, �Why, mother, there is an absolute virtue in such a deed.
Have we not put an end to their rapacity and knavery? And have we not thereby saved
many a foolish maiden from being cheated by them? By Saint Nicholas, but the doer
of so good a deed deserves to be canonized!�
</p>
<p>�But come, boy, thy treasure,� said the greedy and impatient dame. �Quick,�what hast
thou got to show me? Haste thee to feast mine eyes with the spoil of these miscreants.�
</p>
<p>�In the first place, then,� said Murdoch, �as at a feast we should always begin with
the solids,�here is a small bag of broad pieces, which might well satisfy many a hungry
man. Secondly, here are your curious cates and delicacies, enow to bedizen out a dozen
of lordlings� daughters!�See what a chain!�how exquisite the workmanship!�Behold these
rings,�see what sparkling gems! Every one of them set, too, most <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb100">100</a>]</span>rarely in a different fashion! Here is one, for example, which would seem to have
a curious posey in it; some ready-made love verse, I suppose. Let me see,��<i>Feare God and doe no evyle</i>,��eh! ha!�that�that is a good advice, which the last owner, as I take it, was too
great a knave to profit by; but you and I, mother dear���
</p>
<p>�Have done with thy foolery, Murdoch,� said the lady, impatiently; �have done with
thy foolery, and give me thy booty, without farther nonsense. Now, leave me for a
while, and go talk with the old man, whilst I bestow the treasure in a place of safety.
Thou knowest it will all go to deck thy bride, when thou canst find one.�
</p>
<p>�Leave me alone for that, mother,� said Murdoch, significantly. �I promise thee, I
have mine eye on a good man�s daughter, whom I shall have by foul or by fair means
ere I die. But that is a secret I shall keep to myself till the time comes; so good
day, good mother.�
</p>
<p>�What can he mean?� said the Lady Stradawn, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb101">101</a>]</span>after he was gone. �But �tis nothing, after all, but his wild talk. No, no; I must
have my say with him when it comes to that!�
</p>
<p>Now that the lady found herself alone, she doubly locked and bolted the door. She
then spread the gold and the jewels on the table before her, and glutted her eyes
for a time with the glittering sight. Applying her keys to a cabinet which stood against
the wall, she opened the leaves of it, and so exposed the front of a set of secret
drawers, shallower above and deeper below. Selecting other keys from the bunch, she
began to open and to examine the drawers, one by one, from above downwards�her eyes
successively surveying the riches they contained, whilst, with scrupulous attention,
she from time to time selected articles from among the spoils on the table, and deposited
them among the rest, as fancy led her to sort and arrange them, carefully locking
each drawer ere she proceeded to open the next; and thus she went on until she found
that she had disposed of the whole of the trinkets.
</p>
<p>��Twas no great things, after all,� said she, musing; �I wonder when they will go
forth <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb102">102</a>]</span>again? But let me count the money.�Aye, that is pretty well; and yet it might have
been more for the death of two men. But there are other two men I know of, whose lives
would be worth more!�Hush!�did I not hear a noise?�Quick�let me huddle the gold into
this drawer in the cabinet, where I bestowed the broad pieces in the hurry I was taken
with when the Priest came in last night.�What!�nothing there!�Ha!�can the man who�can
the villain have robbed me?�Yes; it could have been no one else.�I see clearly how
it was. He asked me for money�I gave him two pieces from that very drawer. His greedy
eyes saw what it contained, and, whilst my back was turned, he must have cleverly
helped himself to the whole. It could have been nobody else, because I well remember
that I carefully closed the leaves of the cabinet, locked them, and put the keys into
my iron strong-box, before I called Jessy to bring the refreshments.�What a consummate
knave!�But what could I expect better of such a reprobate�a priest who glories as
he does in his wickedness? It would have been well perhaps <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb103">103</a>]</span>for me that I had never seen him.�And yet�But his share of his crime is his own.�Wretch
that he is, he might have had it all for the asking.�Weak woman that I am, I could
have refused him nothing.�Well, I must e�en let it pass, and be more careful again.�But
I shall look better after this bag of broad pieces. It shall be added to the heap
I have here,� continued she, unlocking a drawer of deeper and larger dimensions. �Aye!�
said she, eyeing the treasure it contained with avaricious delight,��that is all safe;
go thou, then, to increase the store, and may my darling boy soon fetch me other bags
to bear these company in this their prison-house!�
</p>
<p>I must now return to the two brothers. Walter, who usually directed every thing in
all their expeditions, never halted until he found himself far up on these very mountains
now before us. He sought for deer, it is true; but, whilst he did so, or rather, whilst
he allowed his brother and his people to do so, his mind seemed to be occupied with
something else than hunting. It was towards evening, when he and the rest of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb104">104</a>]</span>party were still tracking their way through the forest without success, when, they
at last found themselves in that part of it, which then covered the hill that hangs
over the haugh of Dalestie, some miles above this. Partial breaks among the trees
there gave Sir Walter, now and then, a view downwards into the valley below; and,
as he walked and ruminated within himself, as if oppressed with some weighty matter,
his secret musings were suddenly broken by the distant toll of the bell of a small
chapel, which, if I am rightly informed, then stood near the bottom of the hill. The
sound came mellowed over the intervening woods, and Sir Walter started as it reached
his ear. He became deeply moved; but his emotion was not like that movement of piety
which the note of the church-going bell should awaken. It more resembled that, which,
when the hoarse trumpet has sounded, or the shrill pipes have struck up, I have myself
seen convert the godlike countenance of man into that of a demon. Sir Walter Stewart
stamped upon the ground.
</p>
<p>�Dugald!� cried he aloud; �What ho, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb105">105</a>]</span>Dugald Roy, I say. Does that bell call to evening mass?�
</p>
<p>�It does, Sir Knight,� replied Dugald.
</p>
<p>�Then get thee down through the wood,� said Sir Walter; �get thee down through the
wood ere it hath ceased to sound, and tell the proud priest of Dalestie that I, Walter
Stewart of Clan-Allan, am upon the hill, and that, if he dares to mumble a word, yea,
or a syllable, before I come, his life shall pay for it.�
</p>
<p>�Stay, stay,� cried Patrick Stewart, eagerly; �stay him, dear brother! What sudden
fit is this that hath seized thee? A priest!�how canst thou think of sending such
a message as this to a priest?�
</p>
<p>�Dugald Roy, begone, and obey thy master�s bidding!� cried Sir Walter, sternly. �Brother,
I forgive thee this thine interference, though I cannot allow myself to be swayed
by it. Trust me, I have mine own good reasons for so acting, though this be no fitting
time for making thee aware of them.�
</p>
<p>Patrick, whom affection, as well as habit had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb106">106</a>]</span>long disposed to show implicit deference and obedience to his brother Walter�s will,
said no more, but followed his solemn footsteps down the mountain path that led to
the chapel. They had not gone half the way till the bell had ceased to toll. And they
had not gone two-thirds of the way till Dugald Roy met them.
</p>
<p>�Thou hast not sped on thine errand, then?� said Sir Walter, with an expression in
which more of satisfaction than of disappointment might have been read. �Speak, Dugald;
how did the arrogant <span class="corr" id="xd29e1235" title="Source: caitif">caitiff</span> receive my message?�
</p>
<p>�Since I must say it, Sir Knight,� replied Dugald, with some hesitation,��he received
it very scurvily.��Tell the proud Stewart,� said he, �that though he may be lord of
the land, I am the king as well as the priest in mine own chapel.��And so he straightway
began the holy service, but rather, methought, as if he had been dighting himself
for single combat, than for prayer, and in a manner altogether so irreverent, that
the few people who were there, with faces <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb107">107</a>]</span>full of dismay, quietly arose and left the chapel, as if some wicked thing had ta�en
up the priest�s surplice in mockery.�
</p>
<p>�By the Rood, but they were right if they so thought!� cried Sir Walter, quickening
his pace��He is a vile obscene wolf that hath crept like a thief into the fold.�But
I�ll speak to him anon.�
</p>
<p>The rate at which Sir Walter now strode down the hill, kept his astonished brother
Patrick, and the whole party at their full bent. The trees grew thinner as they came
nearer the level valley, and by and bye they ceased altogether, so that a full view
was obtained of the haugh at the bottom. There the Priest of Dalestie was seen leaving
the chapel to go homewards.
</p>
<p>�There he goes!� cried Sir Walter��there he goes stalking along with an air and a
gait, that might better befit a proud prince of the earth, than Heaven�s humble messenger
of peace, as his profession ought to have made him.�What, ho, Sir Priest!�I would
speak with thee.�
</p>
<p>The Priest started�looked suddenly back�<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb108">108</a>]</span>halted, and drew himself up�then turned again, and moved a few paces slowly onwards,
as if irresolute what he should do.�Again he halted, and again he moved on, whilst
Sir Walter�s footsteps were hurrying fast up to him.�At length, he seemed to have
made up his mind to abide that parley which he now saw he could not escape, and, turning
sharp round to face the Stewart, he planted himself firmly in the way before him.
</p>
<p>�What would�st thou with me, Sir Knight?� demanded he, in a haughty and determined
tone.��After the rude and unwonted message which thou hast just dared to send to me,
a holy minister of the Church, methinks that thou canst dare to approach me now, for
no other purpose, than to sue penitently for pardon and absolution at my hands.�
</p>
<p>�A holy minister of the Church!� exclaimed Sir Walter.��A minister of the holy Church,
if thou wilt�but thyself most unholy.�My sins, God pardon me!�are many.�But albeit
that I am at all times ready to kneel in confession, and in humble penitence, before
that true <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb109">109</a>]</span>and godly servant of Christ, the good and pious father, Peter of Dounan, or any other
such as he, I will never bend the knee before one, whose wickedness has been the dishonour
and reproach of the district, ever since it hath been cursed with his presence, and
who yet profanely dares most impiously to approach the holy altar.�
</p>
<p>�Brother! brother Walter!� cried Patrick Stewart, endeavouring to moderate Sir Walter�s
growing ire; �what madness is this! Think of the sacred character he wears, however
little common fame may give him credit for supporting it. Think how���
</p>
<p>�Silence, I say, Patrick!� cried Sir Walter, in an authoritative tone, which he had
never before assumed to his brother. �Again I say, thou knowest not the secret reasons
which move me at this moment. That foul swine, whose sensual snout hath been in every
man�s dish, and who hath uprooted that very vineyard which hath been confided to his
care, must be forthwith cast out. He must be no longer permitted to live. Seize him
and bind him!�
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb110">110</a>]</span></p>
<p>�Lay not a hand on me, good sirs, if you would avoid the thunders and excommunications
of the Church,� cried the priest, now no longer proud, but trembling, and in an humble
tone.
</p>
<p>�Seize him and bind him, I say,� cried Sir Walter. �If there be any one man among
the Clan-Allan here�if there be one Clan-Allan Stewart, I say, who in his conscience
believes that he doth not deserve to die by fire, that man hath my leave to sit apart,
and bear no faggot to the pile that is to consume him. Who among you is there that
doth not know his misdeeds? Not a man answers. Then is he condemned by all. Let each
man, then, get him to the wood, and bring a faggot of the driest fuel, and let him
forthwith be brent, and his ashes scattered to the winds, so that the earth may be
no longer polluted with his carcase, and that even the very memory of him may perish!�
</p>
<p>�Brother, brother!� cried Patrick Stewart, in a tone of entreaty; �do not bring upon
yourself the terrors of the Church. His fame, indeed, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb111">111</a>]</span>is none of the best; but, whatever be his sins, bethink thee that �twere better to
let him be tried by that sacred tribunal to which he is naturally amenable.�
</p>
<p>�By the holy Rood, which this traitor to his crucified Master has so wickedly profaned,
he shall not live an hour,� cried Sir Walter, rising in his rage. �I am but the executioner
of God�s justice on him; and he shall die, be the consequences what they may. See!�see
how busily the fellows toil! Their hearts are in the work. The labour is a pleasure
to them. Not a man hath stood aloof from it, far less hath any one dared to speak
in his cause. Why, then shouldst thou speak brother Patrick? Though thou knowest not
all, thou knowest quite enough to know that he hath well earned the fate I have awarded
him. But though thou art ignorant of all that now impelleth me, I tell thee that I
have enough to satisfy bishop or pope, if need were, that I am now doing the Church
good service. But, be that as it may, I trust the time will never come when the chieftain
of Clan-Allan shall not dare to deal with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb112">112</a>]</span>all within the bounds of Stradawn, whether churchman or layman, as his pleasure may
dictate. Ha! see, the pile is already heaped high, and now they are preparing to set
fire to it; that shows no want of good will; and see, of their own accord, they prepare
to drag him to it!�
</p>
<p>�Then, brother, though I am the younger, I must needs interfere,� cried Patrick Stewart,
rushing forward to throw himself between the men of the clan, and their terrified
victim; �such a deed as this must never be done by thee, my brother.�
</p>
<p>�Patrick, dispute not mine authority,� cried Sir Walter, his rage now beginning to
get the better of him; �my father�s weakness hath made me thy chieftain. Stand back
I tell thee! Stand back! place thyself not <span class="corr" id="xd29e1272" title="Source: between between">between</span> me and my just vengeance, or even the name of brother shall not hinder me from dashing
thee to the ground.�
</p>
<p>�Nay, stand you back!� cried Patrick, covering the priest with his body, whilst the
clansmen retreated from the prisoner at his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb113">113</a>]</span>word. �Walter, I would save this wretched man for another and a calmer tribunal; and,
in thus saving him, I would save thee, my brother, from���
</p>
<p>�Stand from before his polluted carcase!� cried Sir Walter, collaring Patrick, and
casting him from him with a force that threw him several yards away from the spot
where they were contending, and prostrated him headlong on the ground. �Now, Clan-Allan!
now do your duty to your chieftain! I�ll see that my sentence�aye, and your sentence,
is duly carried through!�
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="figure p1113width" id="p1113"><img src="./Legendary Tales of the Highlands, Volume I_files/p1113.jpg" alt="�Mercy, most noble knight!� cried the wretched man." width="720" height="486"><p class="figureHead">�Mercy, most noble knight!� cried the wretched man.</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>�Mercy, most noble knight!� cried the wretched man, as they dragged him along to the
pile, deadly pale, and quailing with fear�his pride all gone, and the terrors of a
horrible death upon him. �Mercy! O spare me! spare me, most noble Sir Walter Stewart!
I confess that I have deeply sinned against you and yours; I confess that���
</p>
<p>�Silence, caitiff!� cried the stern Sir Walter, loudly and hastily interrupting him;
�I am no priest�I want none of thy confessions. Confess <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb114">114</a>]</span>thyself inwardly to thine outraged Maker. Thou shalt have time for that. Down on thy
knees! confess thy sins in secret to Him, and pray to Him for mercy in the next world,
for here all laws, human and divine, tell me that thou shouldst have none; and thou
shalt have none from me.�
</p>
<p>The miserable wretch, trembling, haggard, and conscience-stricken, knelt down at a
short distance from the great heap of dry and decayed timber which they had prepared.
By this time it was lighted, and it soon began to blaze up so high as widely to illuminate
the broad faces of the wooded hills on both sides of the valley, arousing them from
that gloom which had been already gradually deepening over them into shadow, since
the sinking of the sun. Neither his countenance nor his eyes were directed heavenwards;
yet his lips moved, more like those of some one uttering an incantation, than of a
penitent seeking of Heaven to be shriven of his sins. Full time was allowed him. But
the stern Sir Walter Stewart stood over him, as if jealous lest his fears or his agony
of mind, might goad him on to utter some secret aloud <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb115">115</a>]</span>before the clansmen, which he wished to see consumed, and for ever annihilated with
all that was mortal of him who held it. And when he thought that he had given the
wretched man enough of licence, he waved his hand�turned himself aside for a moment�heard
one piercing shriek�and when he looked again the myriads of brilliant sparks that
were rising into the air from the fall of a heavy body among the fuel, sufficiently
proved to him, that the miserable object of his wrath had been thrown into the very
midst of the burning heap. Another, and a fainter cry, made Sir Walter again turn
involuntarily towards the pile. There the head appeared, with the face contorted with
torment, and fearfully illuminated. The body reared itself up for a moment, as if
by one last struggling effort of life, and these half-stifled words were dolefully
heard,�
</p>
<p>�<span class="sc">Walter Stewart!</span>�<span class="sc">THY GRAVE IS NEAR!</span>�
</p>
<p>The Clan-Allan men stood appalled. Again the figure sank. More broken and decayed
wood was thrown on the pile, and they continued to heap it up until all signs of a
human <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb116">116</a>]</span>form were obliterated. Then it was that Sir Walter, calling his followers into a ring
around him, swore them solemnly, on their chieftain�s sword, to eternal secrecy; and
then, sick at the thought of the work they had done, chieftain and clansmen slowly,
and silently, left the place and began to wend their way down the glen. Sir Walter
thought of his brother Patrick as he went�he halted, and blew that bugle sound, which
was well known as a private signal between them. But there was no note of reply. Taking
it for granted, therefore, that the stern act of justice, which circumstances had
compelled him to see done on the Priest, had been too much for the sensitive mind
of Patrick even to contemplate, and that, therefore, he had hurried away to avoid
witnessing the horrible spectacle, Sir Walter pensively and moodily moved homewards.
</p>
<p>But the cause of the muteness of Patrick Stewart�s bugle, was very different from
that which his brother believed it to be. At the time that he had been dragged from
before the Priest, and thrown so violently to a distance, Sir Walter <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb117">117</a>]</span>had been too much excited by rage to notice how he fell, or indeed whether he fell
at all. Nor in the fearful work in which they were all so intently, and with so much
good will engaged, did any of the Stewarts of Clan-Allan once think of him more. Had
Sir Walter known that his beloved brother had been stretched bleeding, and senseless,
on the ground, by his rash hand, and that he was now leaving him to perish without
help, his mind, during his homeward journey, would have been even less tranquil than
his reflections on the past event permitted it to be. The truth was, that Patrick
Stewart�s bonnet, having been driven off by the furious force with which Sir Walter
had hurled him from him, his unprotected head came into contact with a large stone,
that projected out of the surface of the meadow-sward, with a sharp point, from which
he received so severe a cut, and so rude a shock, that he never moved after it, but
lay there as if he had been dead, in the midst of a pool of blood that flowed from
the wound. How long he had remained in this situation, he had no means of guessing,
but when his senses returned to him, he found himself seated, with his back leaning
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb118">118</a>]</span>against the trunk of a great tree, near a fountain that welled out from the side of
the hill. By the blaze of a bit of moss fir that a man held in his hand, he perceived
that there were several people around him, who seemed to be busied in administering
to him. One especially was anxiously supporting his head, staunching the blood that
was still discharging itself from the cut in his temple, and holding a cup to his
lips.
</p>
<p>�How fares it with thee now?� enquired this person eagerly; �how fares it with thee,
my dear friend?�
</p>
<p>�Arthur Forbes of Curgarf!� said Patrick faintly.
</p>
<p>�Holy St. Macher be praised that thine eyes are opened, and that I once more hear
thy voice!� cried Arthur Forbes, �I had mine own fears that thou wert done for. What,
in the name of all that is marvellous, hath befallen thee? Hast thou chanced to come
into the hands of the Catteranes, who are said to harbour sometimes among these mountains?�
</p>
<p>�Where am I?� said Patrick, turning his eyes around him, his brain still swimming
in confusion. �Ah! that fire yonder!�
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb119">119</a>]</span></p>
<p>�Aye, that fire!� said Arthur Forbes eagerly, �what knowest thou of that fire?�
</p>
<p>�Nay nothing,� replied Patrick shuddering.
</p>
<p>�By the Rood, but it brent boldly when we first saw it from the far hill-side yonder,�
said Arthur, �though it hath now fallen somewhat lower. Knowest thou at all who kindled
it? We heard a bugle blast come faintly up from the bottom of the valley, as we came
first within sight of it.�
</p>
<p>�It was not burning when I fell,� replied Patrick guardedly.
</p>
<p>�How did you fall, I pray you?� demanded Arthur Forbes.
</p>
<p>�As I was hurrying through the haugh,� replied Patrick, �my foot tripped in the twilight
against something in the grass, and I was thrown forward, with so much force, that
it is no wonder I was stunned.�
</p>
<p>�Your head must have struck upon some sharp stone,� said Arthur Forbes, �that gash
in your temple is a very ugly one, and it still bleeds considerably. Let me bathe
it for you.�
</p>
<p>�The ice-cold water is most reviving to me,� <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb120">120</a>]</span>said Patrick, sitting up; �I am much better now. I think I am almost strong enough
to walk.�
</p>
<p>�Shall we help thee down to the Priest�s house?� demanded Arthur; �that, as thou knowest,
is the nearest dwelling.�
</p>
<p>�The Priest�s house!� said Patrick, with an expression of horror which he could not
restrain.
</p>
<p>�Nay �tis no wonder that thou should�st shudder at the very mention of that reprobate,�
said Arthur Forbes; �he is a scandal to the very name of Priest.�
</p>
<p>�I would rather go anywhere than to the Priest�s house,� said Patrick Stewart.
</p>
<p>�Nay,� said Arthur Forbes, �it is a thousand to one that we should find him abroad
on some of his unseemly nocturnal pranks; but you might at least repose thee for a
time in his dwelling.�
</p>
<p>�I should find no repose under the Priest�s roof,� said Patrick Stewart quickly. �I
would rather try to make the best of my way to Drummin.�
</p>
<p>�Thou shalt never essay to go to Drummin <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb121">121</a>]</span>to-night,� said Arthur Forbes. �And, now I think on�t, why should you not go over
the hill with me to Curgarf? My sturdy fellows there shall carry you. And then, when
you are there you know,� continued he, sinking his voice to a whisper into Patrick�s
ear, �my sister Kate shall nurse thee.�
</p>
<p>�Your proposal is life to me,� replied Patrick, in the same tone. �I gladly accept
your kind offer. But as to loading your poor men with the weight of my carcase, there
will be no occasion for that. Now that my head is bound up, I feel quite strong, and
I know I shall get better every step of the hill I travel.�
</p>
<p>�I thought that Kate�s very name would be a potent balsam for thy wound,� whispered
Arthur Forbes again. �Thou wilt be better in the hands of Kate, my friend, than in
those of the Catteranes. Lucky was it for thee, truly, that those knaves did not find
thee in thy swoon. They were the people, no doubt, who kindled yon rousing fire, from
which they were probably driven away by our first appearance on the hill. Thou wert
lying scarcely half a cross-bow shot <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb122">122</a>]</span>from the very spot where they must have been making merry, and if they had but stumbled
on thee by accident, their cure for thy wound would have been a dirk-point. Holy Saint
Michael, what an escape thou hast made!�
</p>
<p>The way to Curgarf was long and tiresome enough, for they had to cross over the very
summit of the mountain-ridge�that, I mean, which now divides us from the water of
Don. But Patrick Stewart bore the fatigue of the walk better than any one could have
expected, and there was no doubt that the prospect of seeing Catherine Forbes very
much improved his animal powers. He was already known to his friend�s father, who
received him hospitably, though rather haughtily. The old Lord of Curgarf�s coldness
of carriage towards him was to be attributed to the suspicion he entertained of that
which was in reality true, that a secret attachment existed between Patrick Stewart
and his only daughter Catherine. This he did not wish to encourage for many reasons.
The Clan-Allan Stewarts�to say nothing of what he considered their questionable origin�were
a new <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb123">123</a>]</span>race in the neighbouring strath; and although he had never been actually at war with
them, there had yet been many petty grievances and heart-burnings between them and
his people. These had not in the least shaken the friendship that had accidentally
arisen, during their boyhood, between Patrick Stewart and Arthur Forbes; and you all
know, gentlemen, that the affections of a woman�s heart are but little swayed by any
such circumstances. The bonny blue eyes of Catherine Forbes sparkled, and her bosom
heaved with delight, when she saw Patrick Stewart enter the hall of Curgarf, though
she was compelled to keep down her emotions, and to receive him as a mere acquaintance.
Certain stolen glances did, however, pass between them; and when Arthur mentioned
the accident which had led to his bringing his friend to the castle, and made him
exhibit his wound, Catherine had an opportunity of giving way, in some degree, to
her feelings, without the risk of being chargeable with any thing more than that compassion
naturally to be expected from a lady, even towards a perfect stranger, who came under
such circumstances. Patrick was by this time <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb124">124</a>]</span>satisfied that the wound was of no great moment. But his love for Catherine, and the
opportunity which it thus happily afforded him of being under the same roof with her,
made him very cautious in contending that it was not severe, and he had no objection
to admit, when he was much pressed, that the pain he suffered from the contusion which
his head had received, was very considerable.
</p>
<p>Patrick retired to his chamber that night, his mind filled with the lovely image of
Catherine Forbes, his eyes having done little else, during the evening meal, than
carefully to collect and treasure every minute beauty of her fair countenance, and
graceful person, so as to deepen the lines of that portrait of her which had been
for some time engraven on his heart. But fond as he was of dwelling upon so much loved
an object, he felt it difficult to keep possession of her image, or to prevent it
from being driven from his memory, by the frequent recurrence of that horrible scene,
of which he had witnessed so much, previous to his being rendered unconscious, as
well as to overcome the distressing recollection of his brother Walter�s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb125">125</a>]</span>violence towards himself, and he found it a very difficult matter, to control his
mind so far, as to prevent his imagination from sketching out the revolting circumstances
of the catastrophe that followed, with a degree of detail, and in colours, scarcely
less appalling than those of the dreadful reality.
</p>
<p>Patrick was next morning blessed with a short private interview with Catherine Forbes.
It was short indeed, but it was long enough to give time for the ingenuity of lovers
to arrange a plan for a more satisfactory meeting. It was agreed between them, that
they should separately steal out in the evening, to a grove of ancient pine trees
near the Castle, where, if I mistake not, they had met with one another before, with
the sanction of Arthur Forbes. There they hoped for leisure and privacy enough to
enable them more fully to open their hearts to each other, and to talk of their future
hopes and fears. Contented with this arrangement, Patrick submitted to the confinement
which was imposed upon him in his character of an invalid, and spent the day in basking
silently in the sunshine of his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb126">126</a>]</span>lady�s eyes, in conversing with his friend Arthur as the confidant of their loves,
and in doing all that in him lay to thaw the icy politeness of the old Lord of Curgarf.
An earnest desire to make one�s self agreeable to another, will generally succeed,
in some degree, in the long run; but Patrick�s success with the old Lord was much
beyond what he could have believed or expected.
</p>
<p>�Truly thou art a pretty fellow, Patrick!� said Arthur Forbes jocularly to him, at
the first private moment which he chanced to catch. �Judging by the proximity of the
place where you were found lying last night, to the fire which had been kindled by
the Catteranes, there can be no doubt that you must have fallen among thieves. This
being the case, I, like the good Samaritan, pick thee up by the wayside, bring thee
here in thy wretchedness, pour wine and oil into thy wounds, and see thee well fed
and lodged; and how dost thou repay me, I prythee? Why, not contented with carrying
off my poor love-sick sister�s heart, thou art likely to run away with the old man�s
too.�
</p>
<p>�I rejoice to hear that I have any such <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb127">127</a>]</span>chance,� replied Patrick; �I had feared that thy father�s coldness towards me was
invincible.�
</p>
<p>�Nay, promise me not to interfere with my birthright, by taking away half my father�s
lands with Kate, and I will tell thee what he said of thee but half an hour ago.�
</p>
<p>�I should be too happy to have thy treasure of a sister, with nothing but the sandals
her fair feet tread on,� said Patrick, with enthusiasm.
</p>
<p>�Tush, man!� replied Arthur Forbes, �be assured thou shalt have her some day or other;
aye, and a bit of land, and some good purses of broad pieces with her to boot. But
hear what the Lord of Curgarf said,��Arthur, do you know that friend of thine hath
a mighty pleasant manner with him; yea, and his discourse is more worth listening
to than a young man�s talk usually is: moreover, he hath a certain noble air withal.
I remember that, when I was a child, I was once taken to visit the old Earl of Athol.
His appearance made so strong an impression on me, that I think I see him yet, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb128">128</a>]</span>and that Patrick Stewart is the very image of his progenitor.� There is for you, my
gallant friend! As to finding thee agreeable, I marvel not much at that; for other
people, both men and women too, have been before him in making that wonderful discovery;
and then, seeing that thou didst listen so well to his talk, and agree with him in
every thing he propounded, his finding that your conversation was good was all natural
enough. But to discover that you bore so strong a resemblance to the old Earl of Athol�the
person whom he is ever ready to cite as the pattern of every thing that was graceful
and pleasing in days long gone by, and now never to be matched again�ha! that was
something indeed to give thee a great stride into the citadel of his affection.�
</p>
<p>�Be the breach through which I may be allowed to march in thither, produced how it
may,� said Patrick Stewart, �I am not sorry at thine intelligence. But, much as I
love the good Lord of Curgarf�s converse, I must freely tell thee that I would fain
slip away from it, for some half hour or so, before supper to-night, unperceived <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb129">129</a>]</span>by him, to exchange it for that of thy sweet sister. We have not had above five words
of private conference together since I entered the Castle. So pray have the charity
to keep thy worthy father in talk, while the Lady Catherine and I are out, for a brief
space, on an evening walk.�
</p>
<p>�A pretty use thou wouldst put me to, truly!� said Arthur Forbes, laughing. �But to
pleasure thee, thou shalt be obeyed.�
</p>
<p>The lovers waited with no little impatience for the hour which was to yield them the
desired meeting. When it at length arrived, they stole out at different moments, and
went by different ways to the trysting spot. No one but a lover can fully estimate
the delight of such a stolen interview as this was. They felt it deeply; and the only
difficulty they had was in estimating the lapse of time. The surly toned bell, that
pealed from the tower of the Castle at some distance, warned them to separate, ere,
by their calculation, they had been more than a few short minutes together.
</p>
<p>�Must we then part so soon?� said Patrick, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb130">130</a>]</span>fondly. �How swiftly the moments have flown!�
</p>
<p>�I dare not tarry one instant longer,� said the Lady Catherine; �my father, you well
know,���
</p>
<p>�Alas! I do know,� interrupted Patrick; �yet have I now some hopes of working my way
into his good favour. But I shall tell you more of this anon. We shall meet again
to-morrow night, shall we not?�
</p>
<p>�Yes, yes!� replied Catherine, hurriedly.
</p>
<p>�At the same hour and place?� said Patrick. �Alas! till then I must be contented with
such converse with thee as our eyes may yield us: and blessings on thine for the intelligence
they convey to me.�
</p>
<p>�I hope my father may not be able to read them so readily,� replied Catherine. �But
I must go now.�
</p>
<p>�Stay for one moment, my sweetest heart,� said Patrick. �Ere you go, let me fix thine
arryssade more firmly over thy bosom.� And, as he said so, he took from his sporran
a golden brooch, formed of two entwined hearts, set with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb131">131</a>]</span>garnets. �Wear this trifle for my sake over thy heart. And now may I say, what I dare
not utter in thy father�s hall�Farewell, my love�my dearest Catherine!�
</p>
<p>�Farewell! farewell! my dearest Patrick!� replied she, with a throbbing heart. �I
shall never part with this thy gift whilst life or sense endures; and I shall wear
it ever thus, as thou sayest, over this heart, which beats but for thee alone.�
</p>
<p>Thus they at last parted, with lingering reluctance; and each took a different and
circuitous way to return to the Castle.
</p>
<p>As Patrick entered the hall, a significant nod passed between him and Arthur Forbes.
Soon afterwards, the retainers came crowding in, and the evening meal was placed on
the board by the serving men. The piper had played his accustomed number of turns
upon his walk, in the open gallery over the court-yard. All were ready to sit down.
But there was one most important personage wanting; I mean, the fair Lady Catherine
Forbes. The fashion of the house, as well as of all well fashioned houses of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb132">132</a>]</span>the time, forbade their sitting down till the lady appeared. The Lord of Curgarf grew
impatient.
</p>
<p>�Go!� said he at length to one of the attendants; �go, and send some of the women
to knock at the Lady Catherine�s chamber door, to tell her that supper is served,
and that we wait for her presence.�
</p>
<p>Again the company remained standing for some time. The old Lord of Curgarf arose from
his arm chair, and took two or three turns on the large hearth before the fire place.
Meanwhile, Arthur Forbes stole an enquiring glance at Patrick Stewart, but could gather
nothing in reply. At length the Lady Catherine�s bower woman entered the hall, pale
and trembling.
</p>
<p>�What wouldst thou say, girl?� cried the Lord of Curgarf. �What of my daughter? Thy
looks are ominous! She is not ill?�
</p>
<p>�No, my Lord,� replied the girl, �my Lady is not ill; that is, she was quite well
little more than an hour ago�but�but���
</p>
<p>�But what?� cried <span class="corr" id="xd29e1404" title="Source: Arther">Arthur</span> Forbes, anxiously; �cannot the girl speak out?�
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb133">133</a>]</span></p>
<p>�Tempted by the balmy evening,� replied the girl, �my Lady threw her arryssade about
her, and walked forth beyond the castle walls, as her custom sometimes is, to breathe
the air a little while.�
</p>
<p>�Run!�fly all of you!�take lights, and search for her every where!� cried the Lord
of Curgarf. �How provoking this is! How often have I tried in vain to cure her of
this most foolish and pernicious custom! And then to go without an attendant too!
and beyond the walls!�how very imprudent!�
</p>
<p>The two friends were among the first to hurry out, in obedience to these orders from
the old man. Both were extremely agitated; and, so far as this example went, it would
have been difficult to have, from it, determined the question whether the affection
of a loving brother or a tender lover, should be accounted the greater. Arthur Forbes
was eager for some explanation from Patrick Stewart as to what he knew of the Lady
Catherine. But, alas! Patrick could give him no information beyond that which I have
already detailed to you. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb134">134</a>]</span>Leaving the crowd of the retainers to examine every hole and corner, bush and brake,
immediately around the castle walls, Arthur and Patrick, from their knowledge of circumstances,
pushed their search farther; and as they secretly knew the way that Catherine had
taken from the pine grove homewards, they looked diligently for her all along the
path. Of her, or any thing belonging to her, they discovered nothing. But at last,
in one place, where the path ran through a thicket, where the ground was soft, they
were struck with the appearance of numerous newly impressed prints of footsteps. On
examining these more closely by means of a torch, they observed, among those of many
a rude brogue and sandal, mixed and mingled together, and pointing in all directions,
as if those who wore them had been engaged in hurried action�among all these, I say,
they observed one tiny and delicate footprint, which was here and there perceptible,
and which Patrick Stewart at once declared, could have belonged to no one but to the
Lady Catherine Forbes.�Wild with dread and alarm, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb135">135</a>]</span>they returned to the castle. On questioning the warder, he admitted that he did remember
having heard something like a woman�s shriek, that came faintly from some distance
in the direction of the thicket, but as it was immediately drowned by the first drone
of the piper�s warning, and had been heard by him no more, it had passed away altogether
from his thoughts. Not a doubt now remained in their minds, that the Lady Catherine
had been carried off by some villains, who had been lurking about the castle. The
old Lord of Curgarf was inconsolable.�He was quite unmanned, and unable to give an
order as to what should be done. His son Arthur, the Master of Forbes, lost no time
in acting for him.�The retainers were hastily armed, and commanded to prepare for
instant pursuit; and, being divided, at Patrick Stewart�s request, into two bands,
the friends determined each to take the command of one of them,�and accordingly, with
such hasty refreshments as the men could snatch, and carry with them, they took leave
of one another, and started off, each upon such a line of country as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb136">136</a>]</span>he, in his quickly summoned forethought, judged to be the most likely to bring his
expedition to a successful termination.
</p>
<p>As we have already learned from the conversation of the Master of Forbes, when he
first met Patrick Stewart after the accident which befell him near Dalestie, it was
pretty generally known in the country, at this time, that a gang of Catteranes, or
free-booters, from the west, were occasionally harboured somewhere among the neighbouring
mountains, but no one could precisely tell whereabouts they most commonly secreted
themselves. On this point, however, Patrick Stewart had some general suspicions, though
he knew nothing that could lead him to guess�even within miles�as to the exact spot
where their lurking place might be.�He took his way directly over the mountain that
separates the upper part of the river Don from the Aven, and he descended towards
the valley of the latter stream, through that precipitous ravine, that affords a course
for the little tributary burn of Cuachan-Seirceag, down the face of the white cliffs
that almost overhang the small house of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb137">137</a>]</span>Inchvory, which, if we be all spared gentlemen, we shall see this night before we
sleep. There is not a tree there now; but, at that period, the ravine was thickly
shaded by such timber as could find footing, or nourishment among the rocks, and it
therefore formed a good and well-known place of shelter. Having fixed on it as the
point of rendezvous, Patrick took his way up the valley of the Aven for some little
distance, and then, dividing his people into two parties, he sent one of them off
by the pass leading in the direction of Loch Builg, whilst he continued to lead the
other up that which is more properly called Glen Aven, by the Lynn of Aven, where
the river throws itself over the rocks in a fine wild fall. Having then ascended the
mountains, he began, by break of day, to march, and countermarch, over and across
them, visiting, and carefully examining every retired nook or corner that he thought
might be the least likely to be chosen, by such villains, as a hiding-place, until
mid-day came without bringing him the least clue to the object of his search. Then
it was that he unwillingly halted <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb138">138</a>]</span>his party in a hollow by the side of a spring, that the poor fellows might refresh
themselves with food, and rest for a time.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb139">139</a>]</span></p>

<p class="first"><span class="sc">Clifford.</span>�(<i>Interrupting the Serjeant.</i>)�Gentlemen, I beg to remark, that I think it would be quite proper that we should
refresh ourselves with food, whilst Mr. Patrick Stewart and his party are engaged
in doing so. We shall thus save time, as must be self-evident to all, seeing that
the action of the story is thus brought, for a little while, to a state of repose.
Of bodily rest we have had enough, in all conscience�thanks to the length of Mister
Archy�s yarn.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Grant.</span>�I beg to second the motion of our worthy secretary, which, in my mind, is most sensible.

<p><span class="sc">Clifford.</span>�Methinks, then, that a slice or two from that cold round of beef, which I saw so
carefully bestowed in the right hand pannier on the pony�s back, would come well in
as an episode to Serjeant Stewart�s story. Here Davy, untruss, if you please.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Grant.</span>�Spread the cloth before us here on the grass, and then lay out the eatables.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Clifford.</span>�Now, methinks, we can more readily sympathise with Patrick Stewart and his people
at their luncheon. But come, Davy; we must have something potable too.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Author.</span>�Bring us one of those bottles from the pannier on the other side of the pony.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Clifford.</span>�Aye, that�s right; something to wash the dust out of the serjeant�s throat would
considerably improve his voice. What say you to my prescription, Archy?
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant.</span>�Troth, sir, you�re an excellent doctor. Well, here�s wishing all your good healths,
gentlemen!

time to give one throw over the stream, Archy hooked me here with the thread of his
discourse, and here he has been reeling me out such a line, that I can plainly see
it will be some time ere he can wind it up again so as to land me. Fish!�no, no, I
may as well put up my rod at once, that we may all hear his Legend quietly to an end.

<p><span class="sc">Author.</span>�I think so, indeed.

<h2 class="main">LEGEND OF THE CLAN-ALLAN STEWARTS CONTINUED.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">With a view of multiplying the chances which might still remain of effecting the anxious
object of his expedition, Patrick Stewart had no sooner started again from the heather
where they had been seated, than he subdivided his party into several sections, under
certain intelligent leaders, and having given to each of them such instructions as
he deemed necessary for their guidance, he sent them off in different directions,
with orders to meet together again, by nightfall, at the ravine of Cuachan-Seirceag.
There they were all to wait till he should join them, unless in the event of the Lady
Catherine <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb143">143</a>]</span>being recovered by any of them, in which case they were to proceed in a body, without
tarrying, to carry her straight to Curgarf, leaving one of their number behind them
to certify him of the agreeable intelligence. For his own part, he took with him a
single attendant only, one of the Curgarf retainers, called Michael Forbes, with whose
superior sagacity and activity, some former circumstances had led him to be more particularly
acquainted.
</p>
<p>After all the others had left them, Patrick and his companion began a most particular
and persevering search through the forest, and among the mountains, of that part of
the country which he had especially marked out and reserved for himself, leaving no
spot unexplored that had any thing the least suspicious connected with it. But the
wilderness through which they wandered was so wide, and, in many places, so very thickly
wooded, that they might have been employed for days in the same way, without his being
one whit nearer his object. It is not wonderful, then, that the evening began to manifest
its approach, whilst he was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb144">144</a>]</span>yet actively engaged in laborious travel, yet still he bore on with unremitting exertion,
altogether unconscious of the wane of day.
</p>
<p>The wild scenery by which he was surrounded was beginning to grow dim in the increasing
obscurity, when he arrived at the edge of a deep corry or ravine, in the steeply inclined
side of a mountain. It was a place, of the existence of which, neither he nor his
companion had ever been aware, well as they were both acquainted with the mountains.
The precise position of it has been long ago forgotten; and indeed, if it could be
guessed at, it is probably now so altered, and blocked up, by the fall of the mountain
masses from time to time, as to be no longer in such a state as might admit of its
being identified. But it was one of those rugged places of which there are plenty
of examples among these mountains. The elevation on the mountain side was not greater
than to have allowed Nature, at that time, to have carried the forest partially up
around it, and the wood, that in a great measure concealed it, was chiefly composed
of the mountain pine. The trees, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb145">145</a>]</span>which were seen struggling against the wintry tempests that prevailed around the summits
of the cliffs above, appeared twisted and stunted, yet they grew thickly and sturdily
together, as if resolved, like bold Highlanders in possession of a dangerous post,
to put shoulder to shoulder for the determined purpose of maintaining their position,
in defiance of the raging elements. Their foliage was shorn, not thinned by the blast.
On the contrary, it was thickened by it, from that very clipping to which the storms
so continually subjected it, so that the shade which was formed by their tops overhead,
was thereby rendered just so much the more dense and impenetrable. The narrow and
inclined bottom of the immense gully below, was composed of enormous fragments, which
had been wedged out by time and frosts from the faces of the overhanging crags, and
piled one over the other to an unknown depth, whilst the ground, that sloped rapidly
down into it, from the lower part of the abrupt faces of the precipices on either
side, was covered with smaller and lighter materials of the same sort, mingled with
a certain <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb146">146</a>]</span>proportion of soil. There some scattered trees had been enabled to grow to a huge
size, from the uninterrupted shelter which the place afforded; but whilst few of these
had altogether escaped injury and mutilation from the frequent descent of the stony
masses, many of them had been entirely uprooted and overturned, by the immense magnitude
of some of those falling rocks which had swept down upon them, and there lay their
enormous trunks, resting upon their larger limbs, or upon one another, the whole being
tossed and tumbled together in most intricate confusion, so as to cover the rocky
fragments beneath them, with one continued and almost impervious natural <i lang="fr">chevaux-de-frize</i>.
</p>
<p>Patrick Stewart halted behind the bole of a tree, and, resting against it, so as to
enable him to lean forward over the precipice, he surveyed the gulf below, as accurately
as the evening twilight, and the intervening obstacles permitted him to do. He and
Michael Forbes then stole slowly and silently along the very verge of it, in that
direction that lay down the mountain side, using their eyes sharply and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb147">147</a>]</span>earnestly as they went, and peering anxiously everywhere, with the hope of discovering
some track which might tend downwards into the ravine. While so occupied, Patrick
became suddenly sensible of the fresh smell of wood smoke. From the manner in which
it was necessarily diffused, by the multiplied network of boughs through which it
had to ascend, he looked for it in vain for some time, till he accidentally observed
one or two bright fiery sparks mount upwards from below, such as may be often seen
to arise from a cottage chimney top, when new fuel has been thrown upon the fire by
the people within. Marking, with great attention, the spot whence these had proceeded,
he commenced a more narrow examination of the edge of the ravine, until he at length
discovered a perforation in the brushwood, so small, that it might have been easily
mistaken for the avenue leading to the den of some wild beast, but which, a closer
inspection persuaded him, might have been used by human creatures, there being quite
enough of room for one man at a time to creep through it in a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb148">148</a>]</span>stooping posture. At all events he was resolved to explore it, and accordingly, having
first stationed his attendant, Michael Forbes, in a concealed place, near to its entrance,
that he might watch and give him warning if any one approached from without, he bent
himself down, and began his strange and hazardous enterprise.
</p>
<p>Creeping along, with his bonnet off, and almost on his hands and knees, he found that
the track, which inclined gently at first over the rounded edge of the ravine, became,
as he proceeded, nearly as steep as an upright ladder, but it was less encumbered
with branches than the first part of the way had been, though there was still enough
of growth to aid him in his descent, and to take away all appearance of danger. It
went diagonally down the face of the cliff, dropping from one narrow ledge of footing
in the rock, to that beneath it, with considerable intervals between each. But to
one accustomed, as Patrick Stewart was, to scramble like a goat, the difficulties
it presented were as nothing. All his anxiety and care was exerted <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb149">149</a>]</span>to guard, if possible, against surprise, as well as against making any noise that
might betray his approach, to any one who might be harboured in the ravine below.
</p>
<p>Having at last got to the foot of the precipice, he found it somewhat easier to descend
the rugged slope that inclined downwards from its base, and, upon reaching the bottom,
he discovered that the track continued to lead onwards under the arched limbs of an
overthrown pine, the smaller branches and spray of which, appeared, on a minute examination,
to have been evidently broken away by frequent passage through underneath it. This
circumstance he had some difficulty in discovering, as the increasing darkness was
rendered deeper here, by the overhanging shade of the rocks and trees high above him.
Bending beneath the boughs of the fir, he advanced with yet greater caution, and with
some difficulty, over the rugged and angular fragments, until he suddenly observed
something, that made it prudent for him to halt for a moment, that he might well consider
his position. This abrupt stop was occasioned by his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb150">150</a>]</span>observing a faint gleam of light, that partially illumined the broad side, and moss-grown
edge, of a large mass of stone, a little way in advance of the place where he then
was. He hardly breathed, and he tried to listen�and, for a moment, he fancied he heard
a murmur like that of human voices. Again he stretched his ear, and again he felt
persuaded that he heard the sound of the voices coming hollow on his ear, as if from
some cavity, somewhere below the surface, at a little distance beyond him. Resolving
at last to proceed, he moved on gently, and upon a nearer approach to the great stone,
on the broad edge of which the light fell, he found that it formed one side of a natural
entrance to a passage, that led upwards under the enormous superincumbent masses,
that had been piled up over it, in their fall from the shattered crags above. Pausing
again for a moment, he drew himself up behind a projecting part of another huge stone,
that formed the dark side of the entrance, that he might again listen. He was now
certain that he distinctly heard voices proceeding from within, though he was not
yet near <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb151">151</a>]</span>enough to the speakers to be able to make out their words. The smell of the wood smoke
was exceedingly powerful, and his heart began to beat high, for he was now convinced
that his adventure was drawing to a crisis.
</p>
<p>He plucked forth his dirk, and stooped to enter the place. He found the passage to
be low, narrow, gently ascending, and running somewhat in an oblique direction, from
the illuminated stone at the mouth, for a few paces inwards, till it met with another
block of great size. The edges of this block glowed with a brighter light, that seemed
to come directly upon it, at a right angle, from some fire, not then visible, but
which was evidently blazing within, and which was again reflected from the side of
this stone towards that of the stone at the entrance.
</p>
<p>Having crept onwards to this second fragment of rock, where the passage took its new
direction, he discovered that it led into a large, and very irregularly-shaped chamber,
which was within a few feet only of the spot which he had now reached, but he had
no accurate means of judging of the full extent of the cavern. He could <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb152">152</a>]</span>now see the rousing fire that was burning in a recess, in the side of the rocky wall
of the place, the smoke from which seemed to find its way upwards, through some natural
crevice immediately over it, for the interior of this subterranean den was by no means
obscured by any great accumulation of it. By the light of the fire, one or two dark
holes were seen, apparently forming low passages of connection with other chambers.
How many living beings the place might then contain, he had no means of knowing or
guessing. All that came within the field of his vision were two persons, which he
supposed were those whose voices he had heard. One of these was a slim youth, who
was employed in feeding the fire from time to time with pieces of rotten wood and
branches, and in attending to a large pot, that hung over it by an iron chain, depending
from a strong hook fastened in the rock above. But the youth and his occupations were
altogether disregarded by Patrick Stewart, in the intense interest and delight which
he experienced in beholding the Lady Catherine Forbes, the fair object of his toilsome
search, who sat pensively <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb153">153</a>]</span>and in tears, on a bundle of heather on the farther side of the fire.
</p>
<p>You will easily believe, gentlemen, that it was difficult for him to subdue his impatient
feelings, so far as to restrain himself from at once rushing forward to snatch her
to his arms. But prudence whispered him that her safety might depend on the caution
he should use. Ignorant as he was of the extent of the subterranean den, or how it
might be tenanted, he felt the necessity of exerting his self-command, and to remain
quietly where he was for a little time, until he might be enabled to form some judgment,
from what he should see and hear, as to the probable force he should have to contend
with, as well as to determine what might be his best plan of action.
</p>
<p>�If thou wouldst but listen to my entreaty,� said Catherine Forbes, addressing the
youth in an earnest tone of supplication, whilst the tears that ran down her cheeks
roused Patrick�s feelings to an agonizing pitch of intensity��If thou wouldst but
fly with me, and take me to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb154">154</a>]</span>Curgarf, my father would give thee gold enough to enrich thee and thine for all thy
life.�
</p>
<p>�I tell thee again that it is useless to talk of it, lady,� replied the youth. �I
have already told thee that I pity thee, but it were more than my life were worth
to do as thou wouldst have me. And what is gold, I pray thee, compared to such a risk?�
</p>
<p>�Methinks that, once out amidst these wide hills and forests, the risk would be but
small indeed,� said Catherine.
</p>
<p>�That is all true,� replied the youth. �The hills and forests are wide; but the men
of the band well know every nook and turn of them. Nay, they are every where, and
come pop upon one at the very time when they are least looked for. Holy Virgin, an�
we were to meet any of them as we fled!�My head sits uneasily on my neck at the very
thought!�By the Rood, but there would be a speedy divorce between them! and where
would your gold be then, lady?�
</p>
<p>�Then let me go try to explore mine own way without thee,� said the Lady Catherine.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb155">155</a>]</span></p>
<p>�Talk not of it, lady,� replied the youth, impatiently. �My head would go for it,
I tell thee.�It would go the moment they should return and find that thou hadst escaped.
They may be already near at hand, too, if I mistake not the time of evening. Therefore,
teaze me no more, I pray thee.�
</p>
<p>�Spirits of mine ancestors, give me strength and boldness!� cried the Lady Catherine,
starting up energetically, after a moment�s pause, during which she seemed to have
taken her resolution, and assuming a commanding attitude and air as she spoke.��Let
me pass, young man!�give me way, I say!�or I will struggle with thee to the death,
but I will force a passage!�
</p>
<p>�I have a sharp argument against that,� said the youth, drawing his dirk, and planting
himself in the gap before her.��Stand back!�or thou shalt have every inch of its blade.�
</p>
<p>�Out of the way, vermin!� cried Patrick Stewart, no longer able to contain his rage,
and dashing down the youth before him as he entered.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb156">156</a>]</span></p>
<p>�Patrick!�my dear Patrick!� cried the Lady Catherine, flying into his arms with a
scream of joy.
</p>
<p>�My dearest, dearest Catherine!� said Patrick, fondly��this is indeed to be rewarded!�Wretch!�
cried he, grappling the youth by the throat, and putting the point of his dirk to
his breast, as he was in the act of rising from the ground, apparently with the intention
of making his escape��Wretch! our safety requires thy death.�
</p>
<p>�Oh, do not kill me, good Sir Knight!� cried the terrified youth piteously, and with
a countenance as pale as a corpse.
</p>
<p>�Spare him!�spare him!� cried Catherine,��his worthless life is unworthy of thy blade.�
</p>
<p>�Oh, mercy, mercy!� cried the youth again.��Spare me!�spare me!�oh, do not kill me!�
</p>
<p>�If I did kill thee, it would be no more than what thou hast well merited,� said Patrick.��But,
as thou sayest, Catherine, my love, such worthless blood should never wantonly soil
the steel of a brave man; and if I could but make <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb157">157</a>]</span>him secure by any other means, I should be better contented.�
</p>
<p>�Bind me, if thou wilt, Sir Knight; but, oh, do not!�do not kill me!� cried the youth.
</p>
<p>�Well then, I will spare thy life, though I half question the wisdom of so doing,�
said Patrick.
</p>
<p>Casting his eyes around the cave, he espied some ropes lying in a dark corner. Catherine
flew and brought them to him. He seized them, and quickly bound the youth neck and
heel, in such a manner as to make it quite impossible for him to move body or limb,
and then, lifting him in his arms, he groped his way with him into the farther end
of one of those dark recesses that branched off from the main cavern, and there he
deposited him.
</p>
<p>�Now, let us fly, my love!� cried he, hastily returning to the Lady Catherine. �Every
moment we tarry here is fraught with danger.�Follow me quickly!�I grieve to think
of the fatigue you must undergo. But cheer up, and trust for your defence, from all
danger, to this good arm of mine. Above all things, be silent.�
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb158">158</a>]</span></p>
<p>�With thee as my protector I am strong and bold,� said Catherine. �Thanks be to the
Virgin for this deliverance!�
</p>
<p>Patrick now led the Lady Catherine forth into the open air. But before he ventured
to proceed, he listened for a moment to ascertain that there was no one near. To his
great horror, and to the lady�s death-like alarm, they distinctly heard a footstep
slowly and cautiously approaching. Pushing Catherine gently behind the dark mass of
stone at the entrance, he placed himself before her in the shadow, that, whilst concealed
by it himself, he might have a perfect view of whosoever came, the moment the person
should advance into the light, that was reflected on the wall-like side of the rocky
mass opposite to him, and fell on the ground for a little space beyond it. He listened,
with attention so breathless, that he seemed to hear every beat of his own heart,
as well as of that of his trembling companion. The footstep was that of one person
only, and he felt as if his resolution was quite equal to an encounter with a dozen;
but he knew <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb159">159</a>]</span>not how many might be following, and he was fully conscious of the importance, as
regarded the lady, of avoiding a conflict, unless rendered indispensable by circumstances.
The step came on, falling gently, at intervals of several moments, as if the individual
who approached was unwilling to make the least unnecessary noise. The dim figure of
a man at length appeared, under the arched boughs of the fallen pine tree. He advanced,
step by step, with increased caution. A dirk blade, which he held forward in his outstretched
hand, first caught the stream of reflected light that came from the mouth of the cavern.
The next step that the figure took brought his face under its influence; and, to the
great relief of Patrick Stewart, displayed the features of Michael Forbes. Patrick
gave a low whistle. Michael had at that moment stopped to listen, with a strange expression
of dread and horror, to the complaints of the youth who was bound in the innermost
recesses of the cavern, whence they came, reduced by its sinuosities, into a low wild
moaning sound, that had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb160">160</a>]</span>something supernatural in it, so as to be quite enough to appal any superstitious
mind. The whistle startled him.
</p>
<p>�Michael!� said Patrick in a low tone of voice, �why did�st thou desert thy post?�
</p>
<p>�Holy virgin, is that you, Sir Knight?� said Michael, in a voice which seemed to convey
a doubt whether he was not holding converse with a spirit.
</p>
<p>�What could make you desert your post?� demanded Patrick, angrily, and at the same
time showing himself.
</p>
<p>�Holy saints, I am glad that it is really you, Sir Knight,� replied Michael. �I crave
your pardon, but your long delay led me to fear that something had befallen you, and
that you might lack mine aid.�
</p>
<p>�Had an accident befallen me, Michael,� said Patrick, �thine aid, I fear, would have
been of little avail. But we have lost much time by this thy neglect of mine orders.
Quick! let us lose no more, and give me thy best help to aid thy mistress, the Lady
Catherine.�
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb161">161</a>]</span></p>
<p>�The Virgin be praised!� exclaimed Michael, as Catherine appeared; �then the lady
is safe!�
</p>
<p>�But so for only,� replied Patrick Stewart. �We have yet much peril to encounter;
but our perils are increased every precious moment that we loiter here. Get thee on
quickly before us to the top of the path where it quits the ravine,�the spot, I mean,
where I left thee, and see that you be sure to give me good warning, shouldst thou
see or hear any thing to cause alarm.�
</p>
<p>Michael obeyed; and Patrick, having led Catherine out from under the boughs of the
fallen pine, began to assist her in ascending the path. He had some difficulty in
dragging her up the wild-cat�s ladder that scaled the side of the cliff; but, by the
assistance of his strongly nerved arm, she reached the summit without danger. She
then forced her way through the narrow passage in the brushwood that grew over the
top of the crags, until she had at length the satisfaction of being able to stand
erect, to receive the cooling mountain breeze on her flushed cheek and throbbing temples.
But <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb162">162</a>]</span>this was no place for them to rest. Patrick whistled softly, and Michael appeared.
</p>
<p>�Catherine, my love,� said he, �this is no time for ceremony. Give one arm to Michael,
and put the other firmly into mine�so. Now take the best care you can of your footing,
and lean well upon me as we go down the mountain side. Oh, how I long to talk to thee!
But, dearest, we must be silent as death, for we know not whom we may meet.�
</p>
<p>After a long, rough, and slippery descent, they came at length into a narrow glen,
where the trees grew taller and farther apart from each other. This was so far fortunate
for them; for as the shadows of night became deeper here than they had been on the
mountain side, they were compelled to move slower; and it required all the care of
the Lady Catherine�s supporters, to save her from the injuries she might have sustained
from the numerous fallen branches, and other obstacles lying in their way.
</p>
<p>They had nearly reached the lower extremity of this lesser tributary glen, where it
discharged a small rill into the wider glen and stream of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb163">163</a>]</span>the Aven, when Patrick Stewart suddenly halted.
</p>
<p>�Stop!� cried he; �I hear voices on the breeze, and they come this way too. We must
up the bank, Michael. Courage, my dearest Catherine! let me help thee to climb. Trust
me love, thou hast nothing to fear.�
</p>
<p>�I fear nothing whilst thou art by my side,� replied Catherine, exerting herself to
the utmost.
</p>
<p>�Now,� said Patrick, after they had half carried her some thirty or forty paces up
the steep slope; �we have time to go no farther. Hark! they come! Stretch thyself
at length among this long heather, Catherine, and let me throw my plaid over thee.
Nay, now I think on�t, Michael�s green one is better, the red of mine might be more
visible. There; that will do. Now, Michael, draw thy good claymore, as I do mine.
Here are two thick trunks which stand well placed in front of us. Do thou take thy
stand behind that one, whilst I post myself behind this, so that both of us may be
between the lady and danger. They cannot come at her but by passing between us. And
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb164">164</a>]</span>if they do! But see that thou dost not strike till I give thee the word. Hush! they
come!�
</p>
<p>They had hardly thus disposed of themselves, when the voices drew nearer, and the
dusky figures were obscurely seen moving up the bottom of the little glen. They came
loitering on, one after another, in what we of the army used to call Indian files,�man
following man along the track, where they knew that the footing was likely to be the
best. This plan of march necessarily made them longer of passing by, but it relieved
those who were lurking in the bank above from any great fear of being discovered by
any stray straggler. Two individuals of the party, who had probably some sort of command
over the rest, were considerably in advance. These lingered on their way, and halted
more than once to give time for those that followed to come up, so that Patrick Stewart
caught a sentence or two of the conversation that fell from them.
</p>
<p>�He must be as cunning as the devil,� said one of them to the other, in Gaelic.
</p>
<p>�Thou knowest that she has not yet seen <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb165">165</a>]</span>his face,� replied the other; �so that, when he comes to act the part of her deliverer,
she will never suspect that it was to him she was indebted for her unwilling travel
last night, and her present confinement. And then, you see, he thinks, in this way,
to make his own, both of her and her old father, by his pretended gallantry in rescuing
her from���
</p>
<p>Patrick Stewart in vain stretched his ears to catch more, for on came the rest in
closer lines, gabbling together so loudly about trifles, and with voices so commingled,
that it was not possible to gather the least sense out of their talk. These all passed
onwards; and, a little way behind them, came four other men, who walked very slowly,
and stopped occasionally to converse in Gaelic, like people, who were so travel-worn,
that they were not sorry to halt now and then, and to rest against a tree for a few
moments.
</p>
<p>�What made Grigor Beg stop behind Allister?� demanded one.
</p>
<p>�Hoo! you may well guess it was nothing but his old trick,� replied the other. �The
boddoch would have fain had me to tarry for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb166">166</a>]</span>him, that I might help him, by carrying a part of what load he might get. But I was
no such fool. My shoulders ache enough already with carrying the rough rungs of that
accursed litter last night, to let me wish for any new burden.�
</p>
<p>�If thou hadst not been carrying the bonny lassie for another�s pleasure, methinks
you would maybe have thought less of it,� said a third man.
</p>
<p>Whilst attentively listening to this dialogue, Patrick Stewart observed some ill-defined
object, coming stealing up the slope of the bank, in a diagonal line, from the place
a little way down the glen, where the four men had halted. It came on noiselessly,
but steadily pointing towards the spot where Catherine lay. It stopped, and uttered
a short bark, and Patrick now saw that it was a large, rough, Highland wolf-dog. Again,
with its long snout directed towards the plaid that covered Catherine, it barked and
snarled.
</p>
<p>�Dermot, boy!�Dermot!��cried one of the men from the hollow below.��What hast thou
got there?�
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb167">167</a>]</span></p>
<p>As if encouraged by its master�s voice, the animal barked and snarled again yet more
eagerly, and seemed to be on the very eve of springing upon the plaid. The blade of
Patrick Stewart�s claymore made one swift circuit in the air, and, descending like
a flash of lightning on the neck of the creature, his head and his body rolled asunder
into different parts of the heather, and again Patrick took his silent but determined
stand behind the tree.
</p>
<p>�Dermot!�Dermot, boy!��cried the man again from below.��What think ye is the beast
at, lads?�
</p>
<p>�Some foulmart or badger it may be,� replied another.
</p>
<p>�Can�st thou not go up and see, man?� said a third.
</p>
<p>�Go thyself, my good man,� said the dog�s master.��I am fond enough of the dog�aye,
and, for that part, I am fond enough of travel too, but I am content with my share
of fagg for this day without going up the brae there to seek for more. A man may e�en
have his serving of the best haggis that ever came out of a pot. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb168">168</a>]</span>Trust me, I am for going no foot to-night beyond what I can help.�Dermot�Dermot, boy!�See
ye any thing of him at all, lads?�
</p>
<p>�The last sight that I had of him at all, was near yon dark looking hillock, a good
way up the bank yonder,� said another man.
</p>
<p>�I�m thinking that the brute has winded a passing roebuck,� said the fourth man, �I
thought I saw something like a glimmer just against the light cloud yonder above,
as if it had been the dog darting over the height, the very moment after the last
bark he gave.�
</p>
<p>�Dermot! whif-hoo-if!� cried the dog�s master, and, at the same time, whistling shrilly
upon his fingers. �Tut! the fiend catch him for me! let him go! I�ll be bound that
he�ll be home before us.�
</p>
<p>�Come, then, let�s on!� said another, �I wonder much that Grigor Beg hath not come
up with us ere this.�
</p>
<p>�Hulloah, Grigor!� shouted one of them. �No, no, we�ll not see him so soon, I�ll warrant
ye.�
</p>
<p>�Come! come away, lads!� said another, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb169">169</a>]</span>moving on with the rest following him. �I�ll be bound that the boddoch hath got a
swingeing load upon his back.�
</p>
<p>�Awell!� said one of the first speakers, �rather him than me. But we shan�t be the
worse of it when it�s well broiled, for all that. I�m sure I wish I had a bit of it
at this moment, for I�m famishing. I�m dead tired to-night; I hope that we may have
some rest to-morrow. Know ye aught that is to do?�
</p>
<p>�I heard the Captain say that���but the rest of the dialogue was cut off by the distance
which the men had by this time reached.
</p>
<p>�Thanks be to St. Peter, they are gone at last!� said Patrick Stewart. �How my fingers
itched to have a cut at the villains.�Catherine,� continued he, lifting the plaid,
and assisting her to rise, �art thou not half dead with terror? But courage, my love.
There lies the murderous four-footed savage, whose fell fangs had so nearly been busied
with the plaid that covered thee. If we may trust to what we have just heard, there
is but one man <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb170">170</a>]</span>to come; and, judging by the name of Beg<a class="noteref" id="xd29e1645src" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#xd29e1645">1</a> which they gave him, he ought to be no very formidable person. Michael, get thee
on a few steps in front, and keep a good look out for him. Were we but out of this
narrow place, and fairly into the wider glen of the Aven, we should have less to fear,
and then we shall find means to carry thee.�
</p>
<p>�Thanks to the Virgin, I am yet strong,� said Catherine. �Let us fly, then, with all
speed.�
</p>
<p>A farther walk, of a few minutes only, brought them into Glen Aven, and they pursued
its downward course, for a considerable length of way, until Patrick Stewart began
to perceive something like fatigue in the Lady Catherine�s step. He therefore halted,
and made her sit down to rest a while. In the mean time, he and Michael Forbes contrived
to hew down two small sapling fir trees, by the aid of their good claymores, and having
tied their plaids between them, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb171">171</a>]</span>they, in this manner, very speedily constructed a tolerably easy litter for the lady
to recline at length in. This they carried between them, by resting the ends of the
poles upon their shoulders, Patrick making Michael Forbes go foremost, and reserving
the place behind for himself. I need hardly tell you that the Stewart especially selected
that position, for the obvious reason that he might be thereby enabled to cheer the
Lady Catherine�s spirits, and to lighten her fatigues, by now and then addressing
a word or two of comfort to her as they went. In this manner they pursued their way
down the glen, until the loud roar of many waters informed them that they were approaching
the grand waterfall, called the Lynn of Aven. You will have ample opportunity of becoming
intimately acquainted with all the details of this fine scene, gentlemen, as you go
up the glen to-morrow. But in the meanwhile, I may tell you generally, that the whole
of this large river, there precipitates itself headlong, through a comparatively narrow
chasm in the rocks, into a long, wide, and extremely deep pool below.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb172">172</a>]</span></p>
<p>The sound increased as the bearers of the litter drew nearer to the waterfall, and
the rocky and confined passage, over which they had to make their way, compelled them
to walk at greater leisure, and to select their footing with more caution. Fortunately
they had now the advantage of the moon, which had been for some time shining favourably
upon them, and they were already within a very few steps of coming immediately over
the waterfall, when they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful and most unearthly shriek.
It came apparently from the very midst of the descending column of water below them.
</p>
<p>�Holy Virgin Mother!� cried Michael Forbes, halting, and backing like a restive horse,
so unexpectedly, that the ends of the poles were nearly jerked from Patrick Stewart�s
shoulders, by the shock which was thus communicated to them. �Holy Mother, didst thou
not hear that, Sir Knight?�
</p>
<p>�I did hear something,� said Stewart, not quite willing to increase that dread which
he perceived was already quite sufficiently excited <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb173">173</a>]</span>in his companion, and of which he could not altogether divest himself. �I did fancy
that I heard something. But for the love of the Virgin take care what thou dost. Thou
hadst almost shaken the poles from my shoulders by thy sudden start.�Come! proceed
man!�
</p>
<p>Again, a louder, and more appalling shriek arose from the midst of the cataract, piercing
their ears above all the roaring of its thunder.
</p>
<p>�For the love of all the saints, let us turn back, Sir Knight!� cried Michael. �It
is the water-kelpie himself!�
</p>
<p>�Nay,� said Patrick Stewart; �back we may not go, without the risk of falling again
into the very jaws of the Catteranes. They are no doubt hard on foot after us by this
time.�Forward then, and fear not!�
</p>
<p>Again came the wild shriek, if possible louder and more terrible than before.
</p>
<p>�For the love of God, Sir Knight, back!� cried Michael, now losing all command of
himself, and forcing the litter so backwards upon Patrick Stewart, as to compel him,
from the narrowness of the rocky shelf where they then <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb174">174</a>]</span>stood, to retreat in a corresponding degree, to avoid the certain alternative of being
precipitated over the giddy ledge into the boiling stream of the Aven. �For the love
of God, back, I say! were it but for a few paces, till we have leisure to lay down
our burden, and cross ourselves.�
</p>
<p>�Merciful saints! what will become of us?� cried the Lady Catherine, in great alarm.
</p>
<p>�Now,� said Patrick Stewart, after yielding a few steps, �now, we may surely halt
here till thy courage return to thee, Michael. What a fiend hath so unmanned thee
to-night? I thought thou hadst been brave as a lion.�
</p>
<p>�A fiend indeed, Sir Knight,� replied Michael, as they were laying down the litter;
�I trust that I lack not courage, at any time, to face any mortal foe that ever came
before me. But,� added he, eagerly crossing himself, �to meet with the devil thus
in one�s very path!�Good angels be about us, heard ye not that scream again? Have
mercy upon us all!�
</p>
<p>�There is something very strange in this,� said Patrick Stewart. �But this will never
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb175">175</a>]</span>do. We cannot tarry here long without the certainty of being overtaken by the whole
body of the Catteranes. By this time they must be well on their way in pursuit of
us.�
</p>
<p>�Holy Virgin! what will become of us if we should fall into their hands?� cried the
Lady Catherine, in an agony of distress.
</p>
<p>�Fear not, my love!� said Patrick Stewart; �I will forthwith fathom this mystery.
I will see whence these horrible screams proceed.�
</p>
<p>�Nay, Sir Patrick, tempt not thy fate,� cried Michael. �If thou dost, thou goest to
thy certain destruction.�
</p>
<p>�Oh stir not, dear Patrick!� cried the Lady Catherine, starting up from the litter,
and endeavouring to detain him. �Do not attempt so great, so dreadful a danger.�
</p>
<p>�Catherine, my dearest!� said Patrick, fondly taking her hands in his; �listen to
reason, I entreat thee. The danger that presses on us from behind is imminent, and
more than what two swords, good as they may be, could by any means save thee from.
And since God hath given us strength to flee from it, he will <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb176">176</a>]</span>not forsake me in a conflict with the powers of hell, should they stand in my way.
I go forward in his holy name, then; have no fear for me therefore. Rest thine arm
upon Michael, dearest�tell thy beads, and may the blessed Virgin hover over thee to
protect thee! As for you, Michael, draw your claymore, and stir not a step from the
lady till I call thee.�
</p>
<p>Patrick Stewart now crossed himself, and then strode, slowly and resolutely, along
the narrow ledge of rock towards the roaring lynn, repeating a paternoster as he went.
The moon was by this time high in the heavens, and its beams produced a faint tinge
of the rainbow�s hues, as they played among the mists that arose from the waterfall.
The shrieks that came from below were now loud and incessant, and might have quailed
the stoutest heart. But still Patrick advanced firmly, till he stood upon a shelving
rock, forming the very verge of the roaring cataract, whence he could throw his eyes
directly downwards, through the shooting foam, into the abyss below. Far down, in
the midst of the rising vapour, and apparently suspended <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb177">177</a>]</span>in it, close by the edge of the descending column of water, he could distinguish a
dark object. New and more piercing screams arose from it. He bent forward, and looked
yet more intently. To his no inconsiderable dismay, he beheld a fearful head rear
itself, as it were from out of it; the long hair by which it was covered, and the
immense beard that flowed from the chin, hanging down, drenched by the surrounding
moisture, and the eyes glaring fearfully in the moonlight, whilst the terrific screams
were inconceivably augmented. Appalled as he was by this most unaccountable apparition,
Patrick was shifting his position, in order to lean yet more forward, that he might
the better contemplate it, when the toe of his sandal grazed against something that
had nearly destroyed his equilibrium, and sent him headlong over the rock. Having,
with some difficulty, recovered himself, he stooped down to ascertain what had tripped
him, when he found, to his surprise, that it was a rope. He now remembered, that the
feudal tenant of the neighbouring ground, who owed service to his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb178">178</a>]</span>father, Sir Allan, was accustomed to hang a conical creel, or large rude basket, by
the edge of the fall, for the purpose of catching the salmon that fell into it, after
failing in their vain attempts to leap up.
</p>
<p>�Ho, there!� cried Patrick Stewart, in that voice of thunder, which he required to
exert in order to overcome the continuous roar of the cataract.
</p>
<p>�Oh, help! help! help!� cried the fearful head from below.
</p>
<p>�Man or demon, I will see what thou art!� cried Patrick, stooping down to lay hold
of the rope, with the intention of making an attempt to pull up the creel.
</p>
<p>�For the love of Saint Andrew, lay not a hand on the rope, Sir Knight, as thou may�st
value thy life!� said Michael Forbes, who, having heard Patrick�s loud shout, had
been hurried off to his aid by the fears and the commands of the Lady Catherine.
</p>
<p>�Why hast thou left the lady, caitiff?� demanded Patrick Stewart, angrily. �Did I
not tell thee to stay with her till I should call thee?�
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb179">179</a>]</span></p>
<p>�We heard thee call loudly, Sir Knight,� replied Michael, trembling more from his
proximity to the place whence the screams had issued, than from any thing that Patrick
had said.
</p>
<p>�True, I had forgotten,� replied Patrick; �I did call, though not on thee. But since
thou art here, come lend me thy hand to pull up the basket.�
</p>
<p>�Nay, Sir Knight; surely thou art demented by devilish influence. For the love of
all the saints!� cried Michael, quaking from head to foot; �for the love of ���
</p>
<p>�Dastard, obey my command, or I will hurl thee over the rock!� cried Patrick furiously,
and with a manner that showed Michael that it was time to obey. �Now, pull�pull steadily
and firmly; pull away, I say!�
</p>
<p>�Have mercy on us! have mercy on our souls!� cried Michael, pulling most unwillingly.
</p>
<p>�What a fiend are you afraid of? Why don�t you pull, I say?� cried the Knight again.
</p>
<p>�Jesu Maria protect me! that I should have a hand in any such work!� muttered Michael.
�Oh holy Virgin! to have thus to deal with the Devil himself!�
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb180">180</a>]</span></p>
<p>�Come! pull!�pull away, I tell ye�pull! aye, there!� cried Patrick Stewart, as the
basket at last came to the top of the rock.
</p>
<p>�Preserve us all!� cried Michael; �the water-kelpie, sure enough! Mercy on us, what
a fearful red beard! what terrible fiery eyes! For the love of heaven, Sir Knight,
let him down again!�
</p>
<p>�Coward!� cried Patrick, �if you let go the rope, I�ll massacre thee! Now, do you
hear? pull the creel well out this way.�Ha, that will do!�Now I think it is safe.�
</p>
<p>�Oh, may the blessed saints reward thee!� said a little shred of a man, who now arose,
shaking in a palsy of cold and wet, from the midst of at least a dozen large salmon,
with which the creel was heaped up; �Thou hast saved me from the most dreadful of
deaths.�
</p>
<p>�How camest thou there?� demanded Patrick Stewart; �answer quickly, for we are in
haste.�
</p>
<p>�Oh, I know not well how I got there,� said the little man, shivering so that he could
hardly speak. �I stept aside from the path, just to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb181">181</a>]</span>take a look down to see if there were any salmon in the creel, when something took
my foot, and over I went. Oh, what a providence it was that ye came by! Another hour,
and I must have been dead from cold and wet, and buried in salmon, for they were flying
in upon me like so many swallows. I thought they would have choked me.�
</p>
<p>�Here,� said Patrick Stewart, taking out a flask, �take a sup of this cordial; it
will speedily restore thee.�
</p>
<p>�Oh, blessings on thee, Sir Knight!� said the little man; �I will drink thy health
with good will. But tell me thy name, I pray thee, that I may know, and never forget,
who it was that saved my life.�
</p>
<p>�I am Patrick Stewart of Clan-Allan,� replied the knight carelessly. �Come now, Michael,
we must tarry here no longer.�
</p>
<p>�Sure I am that I shall never forget the name of Sir Patrick Stewart,� said the little
man, whilst he was following them along the narrow path, as they retraced it towards
the place where they had left the Lady Catherine; �and if <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb182">182</a>]</span>ever I can do thee a good turn I shall do it, though it were by the sacrifice of my
life.�
</p>
<p>Catherine�s fears were soon allayed by the explanation that was given her. She was
again put into the litter, which was quickly shouldered by her protectors, the little
man lending them a willing helping hand; and Patrick and Michael proceeded on their
way, whilst the half-drowned wretch went up the glen, pouring out blessings upon them.
Without fear or interruption they now passed by the spot which had occasioned them
so much dread and delay, and they soon left the roar of the lynn behind them, and
at length reached the ravine of Cuachan Searceag, where, much to their relief, they
found the whole of the party anxiously waiting for them. When the Forbeses beheld
Patrick Stewart, and, above all, when they beheld their young mistress, the daughter
of their Chief, safe and well among them, they rent the air with shouts of joy that
made the whole glen ring again.
</p>
<p>�Aye,� said Patrick Stewart, as they sat down to rest a little while, and to take
some hasty refreshment, �We may now make what <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb183">183</a>]</span>noise we list, for, if the whole gang of these accursed Catteranes should come upon
us, we have brave hearts and keen claymores enow to meet them. But, for all that,
we have too precious a charge with us to tarry for the mere pleasure of a conflict;
so be stirring my men, and let us breast the hill as fast as may be.�
</p>
<p>You may all well enough guess, gentlemen, how Patrick Stewart was received by the
old Lord of Curgarf when he entered his hall, leading in his fair daughter safe and
sound. The joy of the father was not the less, that his son, Arthur the Master of
Forbes, had returned but a brief space of time before, jaded, dispirited, and sorrowful,
from his long, tiresome, and fruitless expedition. Worn with anxiety, the old man
had counted watch after watch of the night, and the day and the night again, until
his son�s arrival, and then he had sunk into the most overwhelming despair. After
pouring forth thanks to Heaven, and to all the saints, he now gave way to his joy.
The midnight feast was spread, and all was revelry and gladness in the castle. Patrick
Stewart was now viewed by him as his guardian angel. Seeing this, Arthur Forbes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb184">184</a>]</span>took an opportunity of advising his friend to profit by the happy circumstance which
had now placed him so high in his father�s good opinion. He did so�and the result
was, that he obtained the willing consent of the old Lord of Curgarf to his union
with his daughter, the Lady Catherine, with the promise of a tocher which should be
worthy of her.
</p>
<p>The happiness of the lovers was now complete, and the next day was spent in open and
unrestrained converse between them. The time was fixed for the wedding, and then it
was, after all these arrangements had been made, that Patrick Stewart first had leisure
fully to <span class="corr" id="xd29e1746" title="Source: recal">recall</span> to mind, all those afflicting circumstances which had taken place when he last saw
his brother Walter. He thought of his father�he felt the necessity of going immediately
home, to relieve any anxiety which his father, Sir Allan, might have, in consequence
of his unexplained absence, as well as to make him acquainted with his approaching
marriage. He accordingly took a tender leave of his fair bride that evening, and,
starting next morning, he made his way over the hills to Drummin.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb185">185</a>]</span></p>
<p>Patrick Stewart was already within sight of home, when his attention was arrested
by the blast of a bugle, which rang shrilly from the hill above him. It conveyed to
him that private signal which was always used between his brother Walter and himself.
For the first time in his life it grated harshly in his ear, for it immediately brought
back to his recollection those oppressively painful circumstances which had occurred
at Dalestie, which he had so studiously endeavoured to banish from his memory. But
the strong tide of brotherly affection within him was too resistless not to sweep
away every feeling connected with the past. He applied his bugle to his lips, and
returned the call; and, looking up the side of the hill, he beheld Walter, and a party
of the Clan-Allan, hastening down through the scattered greenwood to meet him.
</p>
<p>�Thanks be to Heaven and good Saint Hubert that I see thee safe, my dearest Patrick,�
said Sir Walter, hurrying towards him, and warmly embracing him. �Hast thou forgiven
a brother�s anger and unkindness?�
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb186">186</a>]</span></p>
<p>�Could�st thou believe that I could for a moment remember it, my dear Walter?� replied
Patrick, returning his embrace.
</p>
<p>�Where in the name of wonder hast thou been wandering?� demanded Sir Walter. �Where
<a id="xd29e1757"></a>hast thou been since that night�that night of justice, yet of horror�when you disappeared
so mysteriously? Since that moment, when I returned home and found thee not, I have
done little else, night or day, but travel about hither and thither, anxiously seeking
for tidings of thee.�
</p>
<p>�Let us walk apart,� said Patrick in his ear, �and I will tell thee all that has befallen
me.�
</p>
<p>�Willingly,� said Sir Walter in the same tone; �for, in exculpation of myself, I would
now fain pour into thy private ear all those circumstances which secretly urged me
to execute that stern act of justice and necessity, which then thou could�st not comprehend,
and against which thy recoiling humanity did naturally enough compel thee so urgently
to protest.�
</p>
<p>Arm in arm the two brothers then walked on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb187">187</a>]</span>alone, at such a distance before their clansmen as might insure the perfect privacy
of their talk, and long ere they reached Drummin, they had fully communicated to each
other all that they had mutually to impart. Old Sir Allan had been querulous and impatient
about Patrick�s absence, and he had been every now and then peevishly inquiring about
him. But now that his son appeared, he seemed to have forgotten that he had not been
always with him. He was pleased and proud when the contemplated marriage was communicated
to him, and he enjoined Sir Walter to see to it, that every thing handsome should
be done on the occasion. In this respect, Sir Walter�s generosity required no stimulus;
and if Patrick was dissatisfied at all, it was with the over liberality which his
brother manifested, which, in some particulars, he felt inclined to resist.
</p>
<p>�Patrick,� said Sir Walter aside to his brother, with a more than ordinarily serious
air, �I give thee but thine own in advance. One day or other it will be all thine
own. There is something within me that tells me that I am not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb188">188</a>]</span>long for this world. The last words of that wretch, delivered to me, as I told thee,
from the midst of those flames that consumed him, were prophetic. But, be that as
it may, I have never had thoughts of marrying, and now I am firmly resolved that I
never shall marry, so that thou art the sole prop of our house.�
</p>
<p>The entrance of the retainers, and the spreading of the evening meal, put a stop to
all farther conversation between the brothers. Patrick had not yet seen either the
Lady Stradawn, or her son Murdoch. On inquiry, he was told that Murdoch had gone on
some unknown expedition on the previous day, and that he had not yet returned. A circumstance,
so common with him, excited no surprise. As for the Lady Stradawn, she now came swimming
into the hall, with her countenance clothed in all its usual smiles. Her salutation
to her stepsons was full of well-dissembled warmth and affection. She hastened, with
her wonted affectation of fondness, to bustle about Sir Allan, with the well-feigned
pretence of anxiety to attend to his wants, after which she took her place at the
head of the board. It was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb189">189</a>]</span>then that Patrick�s eyes became suddenly fixed upon her with a degree of astonishment,
which, fortunately for him, the busy occupation of every one else at the table left
them no leisure to observe. To his utter amazement, he beheld in her bosom that very
garnet brooch which he had given to Catherine Forbes! His first impulse was to demand
from her an explanation of the circumstances by which she had become possessed of
it; but a little reflection soon enabled him to control his feelings, though he continued
to sit gazing at the well-known jewel, altogether forgetful of the feast, until the
lady arose to retire to her chamber.
</p>
<p>�My dearest Sir Allan,� said she, going up to the old knight�s chair to bestow her
caresses on him ere she went; �My dearest Sir Allan, thou hast eaten nothing for these
two days. What can I get for thee that may tickle thy palate into thy wonted appetite?
Said�st thou not something of a deer�s heart, for which thou hadst a longing? �Tis
a strange fancy, I�m sure.�
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb190">190</a>]</span></p>
<p>�Oh, aye! very true,�a deer�s heart!� said the doting old man. �Very true, indeed,
my love. I did dream�oh, aye�I dreamed, I say, Bella, that I was eating the rosten
heart of a stag�of a great <i>hart of sixteen</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd29e1781src" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#xd29e1781">2</a> killed by my boys on the hill of Dalestie�aye, aye�and with arrows feathered from
an eagle�s wing. As I ate, and better ate, I always grew stronger and stronger, till
at length I was able to rise from my chair as stoutly as ever I did in my life�ouch,
aye! that day is gone! Yet much would I like to eat the rosten heart of a deer; but
it would need to be that of a great hart of sixteen.�
</p>
<p>�My dear father, thou shalt not want that,� said Sir Walter; �thou shalt have it ere
I am a day older, if a hart of sixteen be to be found between this and Loch Aven.�
</p>
<p>�Aye, aye, Walter boy, as thou sayest,� said the old man; �a great hart of sixteen�else
hath the heart of the beast no potency in�t�aye, and killed with an arrow feathered
from an eagle�s wing�och, aye�hoch-hey!�
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb191">191</a>]</span></p>
<p>Though the two brothers were satisfied that this was nothing but the drivelling of
age, they were not the less anxiously desirous to gratify their father�s wish to the
very letter. Accordingly, the necessary orders were given, and the trusty Dugald Roy<a class="noteref" id="xd29e1790src" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#xd29e1790">3</a> was forthwith summoned to prepare six arrows, which would have been easily supplied,
with the small portions of feather which were necessary for them, from the eagle wing
in Sir Walter�s bonnet. But Sir Allan stopped him as he was about to tear it off.
</p>
<p>�What, Sir!� exclaimed the old man testily, and in a state of agitation that shook
every fibre of his frame like a palsy;��What! wouldst thou shear the eagle plume of
my boy Walter, thou ill-omened bird that thou art? Yonder hangs mine; it can never
more appear bearing proudly forward in the foremost shock of the battle-field. Och,
hey, that is true! Take that, thou raven! Thou may�st rend it as ye list. But, my
boy�s!�the proud plume of mine eldest born boy!�thou shalt never take that!�
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb192">192</a>]</span></p>
<p>�I crave your pardon, Sir Knight,� replied Dugald Roy; �and now I think on�t, I need
not take either, for I have some spare wing feathers in my store that will do all
the turn.�
</p>
<p>The next morning saw Sir Walter and his brother Patrick early on foot, dressed in
their plainest hunting attire, stretching up the valley at the head of their attendants.
Each of the brothers had three of the eagle-winged arrows stuck into his belt; for,
as both were dexterous marksmen, and as they had resolved to use their shafts against
nothing else but a great hart of sixteen, they felt themselves to be thus most amply
provided to insure success. Fortune was somewhat adverse to them, however; for although
they saw deer in abundance, they found themselves in this very part of the valley,
when the day was already far spent, without having once had a chance of effecting
their object.
</p>
<p>�Look ye there, brother Walter!� at length cried Patrick Stewart suddenly, as he pointed
to a hart with a magnificent head, which was crossing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb193">193</a>]</span>to this side of the river, at the ford you see above yonder. �Look ye there brother!
there he goes at last!�
</p>
<p>�By the rood, but that is the very fellow we want,� replied Sir Walter. �Watch him!
See!�he takes the hill aslant. He will not go far, if we may judge from his present
pace.�
</p>
<p>�I saw him walk over that open knoll in the wood high up yonder,� said Patrick, after
some minutes of pause. �He has no mind to go farther than the dip of the hill above.
I think that we are sure of finding him there. What say you brother?�
</p>
<p>�Thou art right, Patrick,� said Walter. �Then do thou run on, and take the long hollow
in the hill-side, beyond the big pine tree yonder. I will follow up the slack behind
us here. Let your sweep be wide, that we may be sure of stalking well in beyond him,
so that, if we fail of getting proper vantage of him, we may be sure that we drive
him not farther a-field. Let us take no sleuth-hound, nor bratchet neither, lest,
perchance, we cause him <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb194">194</a>]</span>alarm. You, my merry men, will tarry here for us with the dogs.�
</p>
<p>Off went the two brothers, each in his own direction, and each with his bow in his
hand, and his three arrows in his belt. In obedience to Sir Walter�s directions, Patrick
hurried away to the great pine tree, and then began his ascent through the long hollow
in the woody mountain�s side with all manner of expedition. After a long and fatiguing
climb, he began to use less speed and more caution, as he approached nearer to the
somewhat less steep ground, where his hopes lay. Then it was that he commenced making
a long sweep around, stealing silently from tree to tree, and concealing himself,
as much as he could, by keeping their thick trunks before him, and creeping along
among the heather, where such a precaution was necessary. Having completed his sweep
to such an extent as led him to believe that he had certainly got beyond the hart,
he was about to creep down the hill, in the hope of soon coming upon him, when he
chanced to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb195">195</a>]</span>observe a great uprooted pine, which lay prostrated a little way farther on, and somewhat
above the spot where he then was, its head rising above the heather like a great green
hillock. Thinking that he might as well have one peep beyond it before he turned downwards,
and wishing to avail himself of its shade to mask his motions, he took a direct course
towards it. But it so happened, that the hart had found it equally convenient for
the same purpose, as well as for a place of outlook, for it had taken post close to
it, on the farther side. Descrying Patrick Stewart through an accidental opening in
the foliage, and having no fancy to hold nearer converse with him, the creature moved
slowly away. His quick and practised eye caught a view of it through the opening,
as it was going away up the hill, as it happened, in a direct line. Well experienced
in woodcraft, he, in a loud voice, called out �<i>hah!</i>� As is common with red deer when in the woods, the hart made a sudden halt, and wheeled
half round to listen, and in this way he placed his broadside to the hunter�s eye.
This was but <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb196">196</a>]</span>for an instant, to be sure; but in that instant Patrick Stewart�s arrow, passing through
the break in the foliage of the pine, fixed itself deep into the shoulder of the hart.
</p>
<p>�Clumsily done!� exclaimed Patrick Stewart from very vexation as he saw the hart bound
off. �I�ll warrant me the arrow-head is deep into his shoulder blade. One single finger�s
breadth more behind it would have made him mine own, and with all the cleverness of
perfect woodcraft.�
</p>
<p>Patrick, baulked and disappointed, now extended his sweep, and crossed and re-crossed
the ground, with the hope of meeting his brother Sir Walter; but as he did not succeed
in falling in with him, he followed the track of the hart for some distance up the
hill, until he lost every trace of his slot upon the dry summit, after which he returned
with all manner of haste to make his way downwards to the party in the valley below.
This he did, partly with the expectation of meeting his brother Sir Walter there,
and partly with the intention of getting the dogs, that he might make an attempt to
recover <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb197">197</a>]</span>his wounded hart. There he found�not his brother Sir Walter�but his brother Murdoch�who
stood exulting over a dead stag. He was a great hart of sixteen, just such an one
as he himself had been after.
</p>
<p>�Thou see�st that I have the luck,� said Murdoch Stewart triumphantly.
</p>
<p>�Whence camest thou, Murdoch? and how comes this?� demanded Patrick.
</p>
<p>�All naturally enough, brother,� replied Murdoch Stewart carelessly. �As I was wandering
idly on the hill-side above there, I espied the people here below, so I came sauntering
down to see what they were about, and to hear news of ye all. But, as my luck would
have it, I had hardly been with them the pattering of a paternoster, when the very
hart that thou wentest after came bang down upon me�my shaft fled�and there he lies.
Mark now, brother, is he not well and cleanly killed? Observe�right through the neck
you see. But, ha!�it would seem that thou hast spent an arrow too�for these fellows
tell me that thou tookest three <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb198">198</a>]</span>with thee, and methinks thou hast but twain left in thy belt.�
</p>
<p>�I used one against the hart I went after,� said Patrick coldly.
</p>
<p>�And missed him, brother�is�t not so?� said Murdoch laughing. �Well, I never hoped
that I should live to wipe thine eye in any such fashion; for these varlets all say
that this is the very hart that thou went�st after.�
</p>
<p>�Nay, then,� replied Patrick with an air of indifference; �if this be the hart I went
after, I must have found another great hart of sixteen the very marrow of him; and
him I have so marked, that I�ll be sworn he will be known again; for I promise you
that at this moment he beareth wood on his shoulder as well as on his head.�
</p>
<p>�The hart thou sayest that thou sawest may be like Saint Hubert�s stag for aught I
know,� said Murdoch; �but it is clear, from all that these fellows say, that there
lies the very hart that thou went�st forth to kill, and that is no arrow of thine
that hath fixed itself in his gullet.�
</p>
<p>�I did see a hart�draw my bow at a hart�<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb199">199</a>]</span>and sorely wound a hart,� said Patrick, rather testily; �and were it not that the
scent is cold, and the hour so late, I think that the sleuth-hounds there, would soon
help me to prove to thee that he is as fine a hart of sixteen as this which thou hast
slain.�
</p>
<p>�Cry your mercy, brother,� said Murdoch; �I knew not that such great harts of sixteen
had been so rife hereabouts, as that one should start up as a butt for thine arrow
the moment that the other had been lost to thee. Yet it is clear that thou hast spent
an arrow upon something.�Ha!�by the way�where is our brother Walter? They tell me
that he went up the hill-side with thee.�
</p>
<p>�After seeking for him on the hill-side in vain, I reckoned on finding him here,�
replied Patrick. �But if he be within a mile of us I�ll make him answer.�
</p>
<p>He put his bugle to his lips, and awakened the echoes, with such sounds as were understood
between Sir Walter and himself; but the echoes alone replied to him.
</p>
<p>�He may have met with a deer which may <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb200">200</a>]</span>have led him off in pursuit over the hill,� said Patrick.
</p>
<p>�Aye,� said Murdoch; �he may have fallen in with your hart of sixteen�yea, or another,
for aught I know, seeing that harts of sixteen are now so rife on these hills.�
</p>
<p>�Fall in with what he might, he is not the man to give up his game easily,� said Patrick,
somewhat keenly.
</p>
<p>�Whatever may have befallen him,� said Murdoch, �we can hardly hope to see him hereabouts
to-night.�
</p>
<p>�I hope we may see him at Drummin,� said Patrick; �for as the night is now drooping
down so fast, he will most readily seek the straightest way thither. So, as thou hast
now made sure of a great hart of sixteen for Sir Allan, we may as well turn our steps
thitherward without more delay.�
</p>
<p>On reaching Drummin, Patrick Stewart�s first inquiry was for his brother Sir Walter.
He had not returned home; but it was yet early in the night, and he might have been
led away to such a distance as to require the greater part of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb201">201</a>]</span>the night to bring him home. The hart was borne up to the hall in triumph, and exhibited
before Sir Allan, with the arrow still sticking in his neck. The old man�s countenance
was filled with joy and exultation when he beheld it. The Lady Stradawn could not
contain her triumph.
</p>
<p>�So, Murdoch,� said she, �thou art the lucky man who hath killed the much longed for
venison! Thou art the lucky man who hath brought thy father the food for which his
soul so yearneth! There is something of good omen for thee in this, my boy!�
</p>
<p>�A noble head!�a great hart of sixteen, indeed,� said Sir Allan. �Aye, aye, that is
a head, that is a head indeed! Yet have I slain many as fine in my time. Aye, aye,�but
those days are gone; och, hey! gone indeed. See what a cuach his horn hath. Yet that
which I slew up at Loch Aven had a bigger cuach than this one by a great deal. As
I live, you might have slaked your thirst from the hollow of it the drowthiest day
you ever saw. Yet this is a good hart�a noble hart of sixteen,�aye, aye! hoch-hey!
But, hey! what�s this? A goose-winged shaft? <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb202">202</a>]</span>Did I not tell ye that my dream spake of an eagle�s wing? His heart will be naught
after all�naught, naught�och, hey! och, hey!�
</p>
<p>�Nay, we shall soon convince thee to the contrary, father,� said Murdoch, motioning
to the attendants to lay the deer down upon the hearth. �I will forthwith break him
under thine own eye, and thou shalt see, and judge for thyself.�
</p>
<p>Murdoch then drawing forth his knife, began to open up the animal according to the
strictest rules laid down for breaking a deer, as this operation was called, and on
proceeding to slit up the slough, to the great wonder of every one, it was discovered
that the old man was right. The heart was indeed so very small that it might very
well have been said to have been naught. Murdoch was dismayed for a moment at an omen
so very inauspicious, which, in his own mind, he felt was more than enough to overthrow
all the fair prognostics which his mother had so evidently drawn from his success.
The Lady herself was equally disconcerted.
</p>
<p>�Naught, naught!� whimpered Sir Allan. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb203">203</a>]</span>��Tis an ill omen for thee, boy. Thou shalt ne�er fly with an eagle�s wing�nay, nay!
Aye, aye! Thou art ever doomed to gobble i� the muddy stagnant waters like a midden-gander.�Uch,
aye! och, hey!�
</p>
<p>�The fiend take the old carl for his saying!� whispered Murdoch angrily aside to his
mother.
</p>
<p>�Amen!� replied the Lady Stradawn bitterly, in the same under tone. �But fear ye not,
boy, thou shalt wear his eagle wing, aye, and sit in his chair to boot, ere long.�
</p>
<p>This dialogue apart was unobserved by any one, and both son and mother speedily recovered
their self-possession. The lady very cunningly set herself, straightway, to turn the
weak and dribbling stream of Sir Allan�s thoughts from the subject which then occupied
them, to some other, which was to her less disagreeable at the moment, and she easily
succeeded.
</p>
<p>Patrick Stewart�s attention was attracted from all this superstitious trifling, as
well as from what followed it, by again observing the garnet brooch, which appeared
in the bosom of the Lady Stradawn. His thoughts were entirely occupied with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb204">204</a>]</span>it, and his eyes were from time to time rivetted on it. At length it seemed as if
Murdoch had somehow remarked his fixed gaze, for a private sign appeared to pass from
him to his mother, after which she pleaded a sudden faintness, and left the hall,
to return no more that night, and her son soon afterwards followed her. Patrick Stewart�s
mind remained filled with strange speculations regarding the jewel, until the night
wore late, and he began to think anxiously about his brother Sir Walter. Having done
the last offices of attention to his father for the evening, he secretly desired Dugald
Roy to follow him.
</p>
<p>�Dugald,� said he, �I am, most unaccountably, unhappy about thy master. Surely, if
all had been well with him he should have been here ere this? I cannot rid my mind
of the idea that there is something amiss with him. He rested not, as thou knowest,
when I was missing, and it would ill become me to sleep when he is absent. Let us
go seek for him, then, without delay.�
</p>
<p>Dugald Roy readily assented; and both of them having dighted themselves well up for
turmoil, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb205">205</a>]</span>as well as for toil, they secretly left the tower of Drummin. All that night they
travelled, and by daylight they had got into the range of mountains, and of forests,
where they had reason to hope for tidings of Sir Walter. They searched through every
part of the wooded side of that hill where he had last disappeared, and they visited
every human dwelling within a great range around it, but all without obtaining the
slightest intelligence regarding him. Disappointed, and disheartened, they had returned
nearly as far as where the village of Tomantoul now stands, on their way home in the
evening, when they met with Dugald Roy�s brother Neil.
</p>
<p>�What brought thee here, man?� demanded Dugald; �and what a fiend gives thee that
anxious face?�
</p>
<p>�Holy Saint Michael, but it is well that I have foregathered with you both!� replied
Neil. �You must take some other road than that which leads to Drummin, Sir Patrick.
Believe me, it is no place for you at this present time.�
</p>
<p>�What, in the name of all the saints, hath <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb206">206</a>]</span>happened to make it otherwise?� demanded Patrick Stewart.
</p>
<p>�Cannot ye speak out at once, ye Amadan ye, and not hammer like a fool that gate?�
cried Dugald impatiently.
</p>
<p>�Patience! patience!� said Neil; �patience! and ye shall know all presently. In the
first place, then, Master Murdoch says that Sir Walter is murdered.�
</p>
<p>�Murdered!� cried Patrick, in an agony of anxiety; �My brother Walter murdered!�Where?�when?�how?�by
whom?�Oh, speak, that I may hasten to avenge him! But, no!��tis impossible!�speak!�I
have mistaken thee�surely it cannot be!�
</p>
<p>�Master Murdoch says that it is true,� replied Neil. �But the worst of all is, that
he hath accused thee, Sir Patrick, of having done the deed, with an arrow, somewhere
in the wood on the hill of Dalestie.�
</p>
<p>�Merciful Saints!� exclaimed Patrick; �can he indeed be such a villain? But who will
believe so foul and unnatural a calumny? Oh, Walter, my brother, my brother! Heaven
above <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb207">207</a>]</span>knows that thy life was ten thousand times dearer to me than mine own!�
</p>
<p>�Nay,� replied Neil, �he hath called all the clansmen who were there to witness and
to support the strong suspicions which he hath industriously raised against thee.�
</p>
<p>�What argument hath he against me?� cried Patrick Stewart impatiently.
</p>
<p>�He says that the men who were present can testify that you and your brother, Sir
Walter, went into the wood together,� replied Neil; �and that Sir Walter hath not
been seen since; and then, he contends, that the sudden flight which you made from
Drummin, under the cloud of night, is enough to show that you have taken guilt home
to your conscience.�
</p>
<p>�And is this all?� demanded Patrick Stewart.
</p>
<p>�Nay,� replied Neil, �there was more stuff of the same kind, by the use of which he
hath contrived so to persuade them with his wily tongue, that they are all clamorous
against thee. Nay, he hath even warped the feeble judgment of Sir Allan himself to
the same belief.�
</p>
<p>�Serpent that he is!� cried Patrick Stewart. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb208">208</a>]</span>�But let me hasten home to confront this vile traducer. My brother!�my brother Walter!�
continued he, bursting into tears. �My brother Walter gone!�and I accused of his murder!�Oh,
my brother!�my dear brother! Heaven above knows how willingly I would have laid down
my life to have saved thine! Nay, how willingly would I now lay it down at this moment,
were it only to secure to me the certainty that thou art yet alive! The very thought
that it may be otherwise is agony and desolation to me. But let us hasten to confront
this <span class="corr" id="xd29e1901" title="Source: villany">villainy</span>. Let us hasten to revenge! For the love of Heaven, let us hasten home, Dugald!�
</p>
<p>�Nay, my good master,� said Dugald weeping, �for if this sad tale be true as to Sir
Walter�s death, other master than thee, I fear me, that I now have none. Neil says
well that Drummin is no place for thee to-night, with so sudden and tumultuous a clamour
excited against thee. Thine innocence will avail thee nothing. Even the innocence
of an angel would naught avail against the diseased judgments of men, with minds so
poisoned and so possessed. Be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb209">209</a>]</span>persuaded to go elsewhere, until the false and weak foundations of this most traitorous
accusation fail beneath it, and the mists drop from men�s eyes. Who can say for certain
that my beloved master, Sir Walter, is dead? I cannot believe in so great a calamity.
What proof is there that he is dead? There is no news that his body hath been found.�
</p>
<p>�Nay,<span class="corr" id="xd29e1910" title="Not in source">�</span> replied Neil, �he is only amissing as I said.�
</p>
<p>�Thou dost well advise me, Dugald,� said Patrick Stewart after a moment�s thought.
�There is, as thou say�st, no proof that my brother, Sir Walter, is dead. It is most
reasonable to believe that this may, after all, be nothing but a foolish or malicious
surmise. My best hope, nay, my belief is, that it is founded on naught else; and may
Heaven in its mercy grant that it may prove so. I will take thine advice. I will not
go to Drummin at present, but I shall straightway bend my steps towards the Castle
of Curgarf.�
</p>
<p>�Then shall I and Neil attend thee thither, Sir Knight,� said Dugald; �for next to
Sir <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb210">210</a>]</span>Walter Stewart do I assuredly owe thee fealty and service.�
</p>
<p>Sir Patrick and his two attendants now turned off in the direction of Curgarf, and
the day was so far spent that the sun was setting, as they were passing over the ridge
of the country lying between the Aven and the Don. The trees of the forest there grew
thinly scattered in little stunted patches. Sir Patrick was walking a few paces in
front of the two brothers, musing as he went, when he was suddenly surprised by a
shower of arrows falling thickly on and around him. One stuck in his bonnet, another
buried itself harmlessly in the folds of his plaid, a third pierced his sandal and
slightly wounded his foot; and, whilst a fourth struck fire out of a large stone close
to him, two more fell short of him among the heather near him. In an instant his bow
and those of his attendants were bent, and their eyes being turned towards the place
whence the shafts had flown, they descried some men lurking beneath one of the straggling
patches of dwarf pine trees. To have stood aloof with the hope of shooting at them
successfully would have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb211">211</a>]</span>been fatal, for the archery of Sir Patrick and his attendants could have done nothing
against men so ambushed, whilst the Knight and his people would have been a sure mark
for their traitorous foes.
</p>
<p>�On them, my brave Dugald!� cried Sir Patrick Stewart, drawing his sword, and rushing
towards the enemy.
</p>
<p>Dugald Roy, and his brother, Neil, were at his back in a moment. Before they could
reach the point against which their assault was directed, several arrows were discharged
at them. But so resolute, and so spirited an attack had been so little looked for
by those who shot them, that they were too much appalled to take any very steady aim,
so that all of them fell innocuous. Seeing Sir Patrick and his two attendants so rapidly
nearing their place of concealment, the villains thought it better to turn out, that
they might receive their onset on ground where they could all act at once. Six men
accordingly appeared claymore in hand, and as Sir Patrick continued to hurry forward,
he now took the opportunity of speaking hastily to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb212">212</a>]</span>Dugald and Neil, who were advancing to right and left of him.
</p>
<p>�Draw an arrow each,� said he, �and when I give you the word, stop suddenly, and each
of you pick off the man opposite to you, and leave me to take my choice of the rest.�Now!�
</p>
<p>The unlooked for halt was made just as the assassins were preparing to receive the
on-comers on the points of their swords. The aim was sure and fatal. Three men fell�and
on rushed Sir Patrick and his two people with a loud shout. The three, who yet stood
against them, were panic-struck, and, ere they could well offer defence, they were
also extended writhing among the heather, in the agonies of death; and the whole matter
was over in less time than it has taken for me to tell of it. But, uncertain whether
the partial covert of the pine-patch might not still shelter some more enemies, they
rushed in among the trees, brandishing their reeking blades. Up started a youth from
among some low brushwood, and ran off like a hare. Neil was after him in a moment,
and up to him ere he had fled twenty paces. Already he had him by the hair of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb213">213</a>]</span>head, and his claymore was raised to smite him, when Patrick Stewart called to his
follower to stay his hand. Neil obeyed, and granted the youth his life; but when he
brought him in as a prisoner, what was the Stewart�s surprise when he discovered that
he was the same individual whose life he had spared in the Catterane�s den.
</p>
<p>�Ha!� exclaimed Sir Patrick; �said I not well that I questioned the wisdom of sparing
thy life when we last met, thou vermin? What hast thou to urge, that I should show
mercy to thee now, Sir Caitiff?�
</p>
<p>�Oh, mercy, mercy, Sir Knight!� exclaimed the youth, piteously. �Trust me, I came
not hither willingly. I had no hand in this treacherous ambush against thy life.�
</p>
<p>�Appearances are woefully against thee,� said Patrick Stewart; �yet would I not willingly
do thee hurt, if thou be�st innocent. But this is no convenient time nor place to
tarry for thy trial. So bring him along with thee, Dugald. We shall take our own leisure
to examine him afterwards; meanwhile, take especial care that he escape not.�
</p>
<p>Sir Patrick Stewart�s reception at Curgarf <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb214">214</a>]</span>may be easily guessed at. He told of the providential escape he had made from assassination
by the way; but he thought it better, as yet, to say nothing of the mysterious disappearance
of his brother, Sir Walter, or of the traitorous accusations against himself, to which
it had given rise. His resolve to be silent as to this matter was formed, because
he had by this time reasoned himself into the firm persuasion that his brother�s reappearance
would speedily make his own innocence as clear as noonday.
</p>
<p>He was next morning happily seated in the hall, now talking with the old Lord of Curgarf
on one subject, and again taking his opportunity of whispering to the Lady Catherine
on another, when he suddenly recollected the brooch he had given her. It was not in
her bosom.
</p>
<p>�Where are the two twined hearts?� said he to her, smiling. �Fear not, dearest�I am
not jealous.�
</p>
<p>�Thou hast no cause for jealousy, dear Patrick,� replied the lady; �and yet, I grieve
to say, that I have not the jewel. When the Catteranes hurried me off from here, and
just as they stopped for a little time to make up a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb215">215</a>]</span>litter, that they might the more easily carry me, one who appeared to have a certain
command over them, but whose face or person I could not see in the obscurity which
then prevailed, snatched it from my bosom, whilst affecting to fasten my arryssade
more firmly around me. Nay, look not so serious, dearest Patrick! surely thou dost
not doubt me in this matter?�
</p>
<p>�Doubt thee, my Catherine!� said Sir Patrick, kissing her hand with fervour; �sooner
would I doubt mine own existence;�thou art pure virgin truth itself! Think no more
of it. Thou shalt have another and a richer one anon. But say, dearest! why should
we longer delay to set our own very two hearts in that indissoluble golden knot, with
which the sacrament of our holy church may bind them together, so as to form a jewel,
of which neither robber nor Catterane can rifle us, and which cannot be rent asunder
save by the iron hand of death. I have thy father�s permission to move thee to shorten
that cruel interval which thou hast placed between me and happiness.�
</p>
<p>In such a strain as this, did he continue to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb216">216</a>]</span>urge his suit, until it was at last successful; and, to his great joy, it was ultimately
arranged, with the consent of all parties, that the marriage should take place on
the second day from the time I am now speaking of. The bustle of preparation began
in the Castle the moment the circumstance was announced; and it immediately spread
far and wide everywhere around it, and went on incessantly day and night. Joy was
everywhere as universal among the clansmen as their devotion to the Lady Catherine,
the bride, and their admiration of the merits of the bridegroom, could make it. The
day at length arrived. The Castle was crowded with all the friends and retainers of
the family, who came pouring in to witness a ceremonial so interesting to them all.
The Priest had arrived; the Castle chapel had been set in order; the bridal-chamber
had been dight up; and the feast prepared; and every soul was astir to contribute,
so far as in them lay, to the general felicity, as well as to share in it. The old
Lord of Curgarf seemed to have grown young again. Arthur, the Master of Forbes, was
all <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb217">217</a>]</span>life and raillery. Already had the whole company been assembled within the hall. All
the men-at-arms within the Castle had crowded in thither. Even the old warden at the
gate had lowered his portcullis, and made every thing secure with bolt, bar, and chain,
so that he might safely leave his post to the charge of their stubborn defences. The
blushing bride, arrayed in the richest attire, had been led in, attended by her blooming
maidens; and the movement towards the chapel was about to be made, so that the ceremony
might go on, when suddenly a shrill bugle blast from without the gate made the very
Castle walls resound again.
</p>
<p>�Go some of ye, and see who that may be who summons us so rudely,� said the Lord of
Curgarf.
</p>
<p>�Murdoch Stewart, and a party of the Clan-Allan, are at the gate, craving admittance,�
said the messenger, on his return.
</p>
<p>�Son Arthur,� said the Lord of Curgarf, �get thee down quickly, and give Murdoch Stewart
of Clan-Allan, the brother of this our son-in-law <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb218">218</a>]</span>to be, instant entry. Let the gate be opened to him, aye, and to all his people, dost
thou hear? It was kind in him thus to come, on the spur of the occasion,� continued
the old Lord, addressing Patrick, after his son had gone with his attendants to obey
his will��It was kind in thy brother to come thus unasked on the spur of the moment.
Would that Sir Allan, thy father himself, could have been here.�
</p>
<p>The court-yard and the stair now rang with the clink of armed men, and Arthur, the
Master of Forbes, entered, ushering in Murdoch Stewart, proudly attired, and followed
by a formidable band of the Clan-Allan, whose flaring red tartans were strongly contrasted
against the more modest green of those of the Clan-Forbes. To the no small surprise
of his brother Patrick, he no longer wore that appearance of youthful carelessness
and indifference, under the mask of which he had hitherto disguised his true character.
His bearing was now manly and lofty, suited to the command of the Clan-Allan, which
he now seemed to have assumed. His <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb219">219</a>]</span>salutation to the Lord of Curgarf was grave, dignified, and courteous; and, as way
was made for him, he advanced, with the utmost self-possession, into the middle of
the hall.
</p>
<p>�I rejoice that I have arrived thus, as it seems, in the nick of time,� said he, looking
around him, and bowing as he did so, but without once allowing his eyes to rest on
his brother, who stood fixed in silent astonishment at what he beheld.
</p>
<p>�So do we all rejoice,� replied the Lord of Curgarf. �Had we but known that our bridal
might have been thus honoured by the house of Clan-Allan, on so short a warning, trust
me thou shouldst not have lacked our warmest bidding, as thou hast now our warmest
welcome.�
</p>
<p>�Welcome or not, my Lord,� replied Murdoch Stewart, with a respectful reverence, �thou
wilt surely thank me for this most unceremonious visit, when thou shalt know the object
of it. I come to save the honour of thy house from foul disgrace: would, that in so
doing, I could likewise save the honour of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb220">220</a>]</span>that which gave me birth! But although, in saving thee and thy house from dishonour,
the good name of that of Clan-Allan must assuredly be tarnished, it shall never be
said of me, that I preserved it by falsehood or infamous concealment.�
</p>
<p>�Of what wouldst thou speak?� demanded the Lord of Curgarf. �I do beseech thee, keep
me, and keep this good company, no longer in suspense.�
</p>
<p>�Then, my good Lord,� replied Murdoch, solemnly, �much as it pains me to utter it,
and much as it must pain thee, and all present, to hear it, I must tell thee, that
strong suspicions are abroad, that mine eldest brother, Sir Walter Stewart, hath been
most foully murdered, and that he, on whom thou wert now on the very eve of bestowing
thine only daughter, is the foul murderer, who took an elder brother�s life, to make
way for the gratification of his own ambitious and avaricious desires. The circumstances
are so strong against my unfortunate brother Patrick, that all agree that no one else
could have been the murderer.�
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb221">221</a>]</span></p>
<p>�All!�all!�all!�all! was echoed from the stern Clan-Allans, at the lower end of the
hall.
</p>
<p>�Holy saints defend us!� exclaimed the Lord of Curgarf, sinking into a chair.
</p>
<p>��Tis false! oh �tis all false, father!� cried the trembling Catherine Forbes, rushing
forward to assist her father.
</p>
<p>�Infamous traitor!� cried Patrick Stewart; �lying and infamous traitor! Where are
the proofs on which you found so foul and false an accusation?�
</p>
<p>�Would, for the credit of our poor house, that it were false!� said Murdoch, mildly.
�But it is impossible to conceal, that thou wert the last person seen in our poor
brother Walter�s company. Thou wentest up the wood with him, with three arrows in
thy belt. Thou camest back shortly afterwards without him. One of thine arrows was
gone. Thou gavest reasons for the want of it which proved to be false; and our dear
brother Walter hath never been since seen.�
</p>
<p>�He is guilty! He, and no one else, is the murderer!� cried the men of Clan-Allan
hoarsely.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb222">222</a>]</span></p>
<p>�Woe is me!� said the distracted Lord of Curgarf, springing from his chair with nervous
agitation; �the circumstances are indeed too suspicious!�
</p>
<p>�Father!�father!�father, he is innocent!� cried the frantic Lady Catherine Forbes,
holding the old lord�s arm.
</p>
<p>�Sister,� cried the Master of Forbes, taking the Lady Catherine affectionately by
the hand, and speaking to her with great feeling��Dearest sister, this is indeed an
afflicting trial for thee; yet, be of good courage�I have no fears of the result.
Patrick Stewart cannot be guilty of the foul and cruel deed of which he has been accused.
We must have the matter sifted to the bottom; the truth must be brought out; and,
as his innocence must be thereby established, all the evil that can happen will be
but the short delay of your nuptials, till he be fairly and fully cleansed from these
wicked charges.�
</p>
<p>�I am sent by my father,� said Murdoch Stewart��I am sent by my father, and that most
unwillingly, to demand his son Patrick as a prisoner. Forgive me, my good Lord of
Curgarf, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb223">223</a>]</span>for thus daring to execute his paternal order under your roof.�Men of Clan-Allan,
seize and bind Patrick Stewart!�
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="figure p1223width" id="p1223"><img src="./Legendary Tales of the Highlands, Volume I_files/p1223.jpg" alt="�Hold!� cried Dugald Roy, in a voice like thunder." width="720" height="459"><p class="figureHead">�Hold!� cried Dugald Roy, in a voice like thunder.</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>�Hold!� cried Dugald Roy, in a voice like thunder��Hold, men of Clan-Allan! Lay not
a hand upon him, to whom, if my dear master Sir Walter be indeed gone, ye must all
soon, in the course of nature, swear fealty as your chieftain. He is guiltless of
my beloved master�s murder, though murdered, I fear, he hath most foully been. But
here is one who can tell more of this cruel and wicked deed. Come hither boy, and
tell us what thou may�st know of this mysterious matter.�
</p>
<p>Dugald Roy then led forward the youth whom he had brought prisoner to Curgarf, of
whose very existence Sir Patrick Stewart had lost all recollection, amidst the tumult
of joy in which he had been so continually kept by his approaching nuptials. The Lady
Catherine Forbes started with surprise when she beheld him; but the countenance of
Murdoch Stewart turned as pale as a linen sheet at the sight of him.
</p>
<p>�What hast thou to say, young man, to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb224">224</a>]</span>clearing up of this dark and cruel mystery?� demanded the Lord of Curgarf.
</p>
<p>�My Lord, I saw Sir Walter Stewart of Clan-Allan murdered,� said the youth in a tremulous
voice. �I saw him shot to the death by the arrow of Ewan Cameron, one of the band
of Catteranes.�
</p>
<p>�How camest thou to have been in any such evil company?� demanded the Lord of Curgarf.
</p>
<p>�Trusting to have mercy at your hands, my Lord, I will tell my whole story as shortly
as I can, if thou wilt but listen to me,� replied the youth. �I was prentice to a
craftsman in the town of Banff, a man who wrought in gold and silver. Being one day
severely chidden by my master for some unlucky fault, the devil entered into me, and
I resolved to be revenged of him. Having become known to the captain of a certain
band of Catteranes, I stole my master�s keys, and gave them to him, so that he and
his gang were enabled to rifle the goldsmith�s stores of all his valuables. In dread
of punishment I fled with them to their den in the hills, where they afterwards kept
me in thrall to do their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb225">225</a>]</span>service. The lady, thy daughter, can tell thee that I was there when she was brought
in by them, and had not Sir Patrick Stewart left me bound when he spared my life,
they would have certainly taken it on their return, in their rage and fury at her
escape; but, fortunately, I was lying quite out of their way at the moment, and was
not discovered till they had somewhat cooled. Finding that their retreat had been
found out, they hastily abandoned it, and dispersed themselves through the hills.
On the day that followed after that, we were all collected together to meet our captain;
and after two days more, a breathless messenger came early in the morning to tell
him something which was kept secret from all else. There were but few of the band
with him at the time; but these were ordered to arm on the sudden; and even I, who
had never been called out on any expedition until that day, was commanded to arm like
the rest.
</p>
<p>�Our small party marched off in all haste, and about mid-day we were planted in ambush
on the side of a hill above the Aven. Our captain seemed to be restless and anxious.
He <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb226">226</a>]</span>moved about from place to place, stretching on tiptoe from the top of every knoll,
and sometimes climbing the tallest pine trees, in order to scan the valley below more
narrowly. At length, as it grew late in the afternoon, he took a long look from one
point, and then, as if he had at last made some discovery of importance, he suddenly
moved us off into a thicket, which grew on the edge of a considerable opening in the
wood on the hill-side; and I would know that opening again, for it had the green quaking
bog of a well-head in the very midst of it.
</p>
<p>�We had not stood long there, till a man in very plain attire, with a bow in his hand,
came up from the thick wood below, and began to pass aslant the open space. �There
goes a good mark for an arrow,� said the captain of the band. �Shoot at him, my men.���He
is not worth a shaft,� replied some of his people. �He is a poor fellow who hath nothing
in his sporran to pay for the killing of him.���No matter,� said Ewan Cameron, �he
hath a good pair of sandals on him; and my brogues are worn to shreds�so, here goes
at him.� And just as the man <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb227">227</a>]</span>was passing along the bank close above the well-eye, the arrow fled, and pierced him
to the heart. �Well shot, Ewan!� cried the captain, in a strange ecstasy of joy; �thou
shalt have gold for that shot of thine.� So instant was his death, that he sprang
high into the air, and his body fell headlong and without life into the very middle
of the bog, with a force that buried it in its yielding mass, so high, that nothing
was seen of him but his legs. Ewan hastened to the place, quietly took off the sandals
from the dead man, threw off his own brogues, and put on the sandals in place of them,
and then the captain himself ran eagerly to help him to force the corpse downwards
into the bog; and this they did till the green moss closed over the soles of its feet.
I then knew not who the murdered man might be,�and the deed was no sooner done, than
our captain ordered us to make our way back, as fast as we could travel, over the
hills, whilst he left us to go directly down into the glen.
</p>
<p>�Early next morning, a messenger again came to us; and five picked archers were sent
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb228">228</a>]</span>out under the orders of Ewan Cameron. I was directed to accompany them; and I marvelled
much why I, who was so inexperienced, should be required to go on an expedition where
they seemed to be so very particular in choosing their men. But Ewan Cameron soon
let me into the secret. �Thou knowest the person of Patrick Stewart of Clan-Allan,
dost thou not?� said he to me.��If that was he who took the lady from the cave, and
left me bound, replied I, �then have I reason to remember him right well.���Then must
I tell thee, that we are now sent forth expressly to hunt for him, and to take his
life,� replied Ewan; �and if thou would�st fain preserve thine own, thou wilt need
to look sharply about thee, that thou mayest tell me when thou seest him.���Who covets
to have his life?� demanded I.���He who made me take the life of his brother Walter,
for those sandals which I now wear,� said Ewan.��What! our captain?� exclaimed I;
�that must be in revenge, because Sir Patrick Stewart took the lady from him.���Partly
so, perhaps,� replied Ewan; �but I am rather jealous that our captain�s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb229">229</a>]</span>greatest fault to Sir Patrick Stewart is, that he, like his brother, Sir Walter Stewart,
was born before him. Knowest thou not, that our captain is no other than Murdoch Stewart,
the third son of old Sir Allan of Stradawn?� I was no sooner made aware of this, than��
</p>
<p>The youth would have proceeded, but the loud murmur of astonishment and horror that
arose every where throughout the hall, so drowned his voice, that he was compelled
to stop.
</p>
<p>�Holy Saint Michael, what a perfect villain thou art!� exclaimed the old Lord of Curgarf,
darting a look of indignant detestation at Murdoch Stewart.
</p>
<p>�Thou wouldst not condemn a stranger unheard,� said Murdoch, calmly.
</p>
<p>�Nay,� replied the Lord of Curgarf, �thou shalt have full justice. We shall hear thee
anon. But let this youth finish his narrative, which would seem to be pregnant with
strange and horrible things.�
</p>
<p>�I have but little more to say,� continued the youth. �Gratitude to Sir Patrick Stewart,
for having spared my life, when his own security <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb230">230</a>]</span>might have required the taking of it, at once resolved me against betraying him to
slaughter. Ewan Cameron marched us straight away to the hill, which rises above the
track that leads from the little place of Tomantoul to the river Don, and there he
kept us sitting, for some time, watching, till we espied three men coming along the
way. Whilst they were yet afar off I knew one of them to be the very person whom the
murderers were in search of. �Is that Sir Patrick Stewart that comes first yonder?�
demanded Ewan.��I cannot tell at this distance,� said I; �but I think the man I saw
in the cave was much taller than that man.���That is a tall man,� said Ewan; �take
care what thou sayest, or thou mayest chance to have thy stature curtailed by the
whole head.���I say what is true,� said I; �no man could know his own father at that
distance.���Then will I assert that thou sayest that which is a lie,� said one of
the party; �for great as the distance may be, I know that to be Sir Patrick Stewart.
I mean that man who comes first of the three.���Let us down upon him without loss
of time <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb231">231</a>]</span>then,� cried Ewan; �and do you come along, Sirrah! Thou shalt along with us; and,
when our work is done, we shall see whether we cannot find the means of refreshing
thy memory.� Having uttered these words, Ewan hurried us all down to the covert of
a small patch of stunted pines, that grew on the flat ground below. There we lay in
ambush till Sir Patrick Stewart, and his two attendants, came within bowshot, and
there, as is already known to most here, the six assassins were speedily punished
for their wicked attempt, and I became Sir Patrick Stewart�s prisoner.�
</p>
<p>�Now,� said the Lord of Curgarf, addressing himself to Murdoch, <span class="corr" id="xd29e2033" title="Not in source">�</span>what hast thou to say in answer to all this?�What hast thou to answer for thyself?�
</p>
<p>�I say that the young caitiff is a foul liar!� cried Murdoch violently. <span class="corr" id="xd29e2037" title="Not in source">�</span>He is a foul liar, who hath been taught a false tale, to bear me down.�
</p>
<p>�He may be a liar,� said the Lord of Curgarf; �but his story hangs marvellously well
together.�
</p>
<p>�Who would dare to condemn me on his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb232">232</a>]</span>unsupported testimony?� demanded Murdoch, boldly.
</p>
<p>�Here is one who is ready to support his tale,� said Michael Forbes, pressing forward,
and pushing before him a strange looking little man, with a long red beard, and a
head of hair so untamed, that it hung over his sharp sallow features in such a manner,
as, for some moments, to render it difficult for Sir Patrick Stewart to recognise
in him, the man whom he had saved from his perilous position in the salmon creel,
at the Lynn of Aven.
</p>
<p>�Ha!�Grigor Beg!� cried Murdoch Stewart, betrayed by his surprise, at beholding him;
�What a fiend hath brought thee hither?�But thou�thou can�st say nothing against me.�
</p>
<p>�I fear I can say nothing for thee, Murdoch Stewart,� said the little man, darting
a pair of piercing eyes towards him, from amidst the tangled thickets of his hair.
�Nor is it needful for me now to say all I might against thee. But here, as I understand,
thou hast basely and falsely accused thy brother Sir Patrick Stewart of murdering
his elder brother Sir Walter. Now, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb233">233</a>]</span>I saw Ewan Cameron shoot down Sir Walter Stewart with an arrow; and it was done at
thy bidding too, for I was by, on the hill-side, when thou didst give to Ewan Cameron
his secret order to slay thy brother, and when thou didst teach him to do the deed,
as if it were an idle act, done against a stranger.�
</p>
<p>�Lies!�lies!�a very net-work of lies, in which to ensnare me!� cried Murdoch. �But
who can condemn me for another�s death, who, for aught that we know truly, may yet
appear alive and well?�
</p>
<p>�Thou hadst no such scruple in condemning thine innocent brother, Sir Patrick,� said
the Lord of Curgarf; �yet shall no guilt be fixed upon thee, till thy brother�s death
be established beyond question. Meanwhile thou must be a bounden prisoner, till the
truth be clearly brought to light.�
</p>
<p>�Men of Clan-Allan! will ye allow him who must be your chieftain to be laid hands
on in the house of a stranger?� cried Murdoch Stewart aloud. �You are armed; use your
weapons then, and leave not a man alive!�
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb234">234</a>]</span></p>
<p>A thrill of horror ran through every bosom. There were brave men enough of the Clan-Forbes
there, to have made head against three times the number of Clan-Allans that now stood,
armed to the teeth, and in a firm body, at the lower end of the hall; but there was
not a man of the Forbeses, who, if not altogether unarmed, had any weapon at all to
defend himself with but his dirk. Those who had such instruments were drawing them,
whilst others were rushing to the walls, to arm themselves with whatsoever weapons
they could most easily reach, and pluck down thence. The noise and bustle of the moment
was great, when, all at once, there fell a hush over the turbulence of the scene.
</p>
<p>�Stir not a man of Clan-Allan!� cried Sir Patrick to the Stewarts, who stood in their
array, like a heavy and portentous thundercloud. �Stir not, men of Clan-Allan!�Stir
not a finger, I command you!�
</p>
<p>�Sir Patrick Stewart is our young chieftain!� broke like a roll of Heaven�s artillery
from the Clan-Allans. �Sir Patrick Stewart is our <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb235">235</a>]</span>young chieftain! Murdoch is a foul traitor and murderer! Bind him, bind him! Let him
be the prisoner, and let us have him forthwith justified!�
</p>
<p>�Nay, nay,� cried Sir Patrick; �bind him if you will, but lay not your hands upon
his life. This day, my Catherine,� said he, turning to the lady, and addressing her
tenderly and sorrowfully; �This day, that was to have been to me so full of joy, must
now, alas! be the first of that doleful time, which, in the bereavement of my heart,
I must devote to mourning for my beloved brother Walter. My first duty is to go and
seek for his remains; and in following out this most sad and anxious search, I must
crave thy presence, my Lord of Curgarf, and thine, too, Arthur, with that of such
of our friends as may be disposed to go forth with us, to aid us in so painful a quest.�
</p>
<p>The wishes of Sir Patrick Stewart were readily agreed to. The nuptials were for the
present postponed; and instead of the marriage-feast, some hasty refreshment was taken,
preparatory to their immediate departure on their melancholy search. The treacherous
Murdoch <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb236">236</a>]</span>Stewart was now given in charge, as a manacled prisoner, to those very Clan-Allans,
at the head of whom he had come, so triumphantly, to fix a false accusation on his
brother Sir Patrick. With them too went the youth, and the little man, Grigor Beg,
who had given their evidence against Murdoch. The old Lord of Curgarf�s quiet palfrey
was led forth; and he set forward, attended by Arthur the Master of Forbes, Sir Patrick
Stewart, and a considerable following of those who were led to accompany him by duty,
or from curiosity.
</p>
<p>They first visited the scene of the attempted <span class="corr" id="xd29e2069" title="Source: assasination">assassination</span> of Sir Patrick Stewart. The spot where the six Catteranes were slain, was easily
discovered, by the flock of birds of prey that sat perched upon the tops of the dwarf
pines, or that wheeled over them in whistling circles; whilst every now and then,
some individual, bolder than the rest, would swoop down on the heath, to partake of
the banquet which had been spread upon it for them. That some considerable share of
courage was required to enable these creatures to do this, was proved to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb237">237</a>]</span>the party, who, on their nearer approach, scared away a brace of hungry, gaunt-looking
wolves, who had been employed in ravenously tearing at the bodies, and dragging them
hither and thither with bloody jaws; as well as an eagle, who had dared to sit a little
way apart, to feed upon one of the carcases, in defiance of his ferocious four-footed
fellow-guests. The spectacle was shocking to all who beheld it. But one object of
their search was gained; for, on examination, Patrick recognised his brother Walter�s
sandals, which were removed from the feet of the corpse of Ewan Cameron, and taken
care of�thus so far corroborating the testimony of the youth. Having completed their
investigations in this place, they piled heaps of stones over the bodies on the spot
where they lay, and the party then pursued their way, over the mountain, towards the
alleged scene of Sir Walter Stewart�s murder.
</p>
<p>Providence seemed to guide their steps;�for, as they passed over the brow of the wooded
hill that dropped down towards the Aven, they scared away two ravens from a hollow
place in the heath; and, on approaching the spot, they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb238">238</a>]</span>discovered the well-picked bones of a deer. His head showed him to have been an unusually
fine great hart of sixteen. An arrow was sticking so deeply fixed through the shoulder-blade,
as to satisfy all present, that its point must have produced death, very soon after
the animal had received it.
</p>
<p>�As I hope for mercy, there is the very arrow that was lacking of Sir Patrick�s three!�
cried Dugald Roy, triumphantly. �See�there is the very eagle�s feather which I put
on it, with mine own hand! And, look�there is the cross, which I always cut on the
shaft, to give them good luck. No shaft of mine, so armed, ever misses, when righteously
discharged. But for foul or treacherous murther, I�ll warrant me, that the most practised
eye could never bring it to a true aim. But� added he, as he very adroitly dislocated
out the shoulder-bone, as Highlanders are wont, and then possessed himself of the
shoulder-blade, arrow and all��I�ll e�en take this arrow with me, with the bone just
as it is, as a dumb but true witness in a righteous cause.�
</p>
<p>Led by the directions which they received <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb239">239</a>]</span>from Grigor Beg, they now descended through the forest, till they came to that very
well-eye you see yonder�for that was the very individual place, that both the old
man and the youth had described as the scene of Sir Walter�s murder. They had used
the precaution to bring with them implements for digging; and, by means of these,
a few sturdy fellows were soon enabled to make an opening into the lower end of the
quaking bog, so as very quickly to discharge the pent-up water within it. The green
surface then gradually subsided, and the legs of a human being, with hose on, but
without sandals, began to appear, sticking out, with the feet upwards; and, by digging
a little around it, they soon succeeded in bringing the body of Sir Walter Stewart
fully to light. It was in all respects unchanged. The fatal arrow was deeply buried
in his left breast; his bow was firmly grasped in his hand; and his three eagle-winged
shafts were in his belt. The small unplumed bonnet which he usually wore, when dressed
for following the deer, was fast squeezed down on his head, by the pressure which
had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb240">240</a>]</span>been exerted to sink him. How differently were the two brothers, Patrick and Murdoch
Stewart, affected by the harrowing spectacle which was now brought before their eyes!
Murdoch shed no tear�yet his features were strongly agitated. He looked at the corpse
with averted eyes, and shuddered as he looked; whilst his face became black, and again
deadly pale, twenty times alternately. Sir Patrick Stewart, on the other hand, threw
himself, in an agony of tears, on the cold and dripping body of his murdered brother,
as it lay exposed on the bank; and, unable to give utterance to his grief, he clasped
it to his bosom, and lavished fond, though unavailing caresses on it. In vain he essayed,
with as much tenderness as if his brother could have still felt the pain he might
thereby have given him, to pluck forth the arrow, deeply buried in the fatal wound.
All present were overcome by this sad scene;�but poor Dugald Roy hung over them, and
sobbed aloud, till the violence of his grief recalled Sir Patrick Stewart to himself
again.
</p>
<p>�Aye!� said Dugald Roy; �that is a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb241">241</a>]</span>murderous shaft indeed! A good cloth-yard in length, I�ll warrant me; and feathered,
too, from the wing of some ill-omened grey goose, that was hatched in some western
sea-loch. This is no arrow of the make of Aven-side, else am I no judge of the tool.
No cross upon this, I�ll be sworn. No, no.�By St. Peter, but it hath murther in the
very look of it! Aye, and there are the true arrows of the cross in his belt!�These
are of my winging, every one of them. Little did I think, when I stuck them into my
poor master�s girdle, that this was to be the way in which I was to find them! Would
that he had but gotten fair play! Would that he had but got his eye on the villains
ere they slew him! If he had but gotten one glimpse of them, by the Rood, but every
cross of these shafts would have been eager to have dyed itself red in the blood of
their cowardly hearts!�
</p>
<p>The body of Sir Walter Stewart was now wrapped up in a plaid, and fastened lengthwise
upon two parallel boughs, and it was borne towards Drummin. Their movements were so
slow, and so often interrupted, that it was dark <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb242">242</a>]</span>night long ere they came to the place of their destination. Sir Patrick Stewart felt
the necessity of preparing his father, Sir Allan, for the coming scene, as well as
for the reception of the Lord of Curgarf, and his son, the Master of Forbes. He therefore
resolved to hurry on before the party, that he might have a private meeting with the
old Knight, before their arrival. But being fully aware that Sir Allan�s mind had
been already filled with those iniquitous falsehoods, which his wicked brother, Murdoch
Stewart, had engendered against him, he thought it prudent to take with him Dugald
Roy, and two other men of the Clan-Allans, that they might be prepared, if necessary,
to support his justification of himself.
</p>
<p>As Sir Patrick Stewart, and his small escort, approached the outer gate of the Castle
of Drummin, they perceived that it was shut. Dugald had no sooner observed this circumstance,
than he made a signal to the Knight to remain silent, and then he advanced quietly
to the little wicket in the middle of the gate, and knocked gently.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb243">243</a>]</span></p>
<p>�Who is there?� demanded the Warder, from within.
</p>
<p>�Open the wicket, man, without a moment�s tarrying,� replied Dugald.
</p>
<p>�Is that thee, Dugald Roy?� demanded the Warder.
</p>
<p>�Who else could it be?� replied Dugald.
</p>
<p>�It may be that any other might have done as well,� replied the Warder gruffly. �Thou
wentst not forth with Murdoch Stewart;�Art thou of his company at the present time?�
</p>
<p>�What matter though I went not forth with him, if I come home in his company?� replied
Dugald readily.
</p>
<p>�Is he with thee, then?� demanded the Warder.
</p>
<p>�To be sure he is,� cried Dugald impatiently. �Come, man! he is close at hand, I tell
thee. Come! art thou to keep us standing here all night? By all that�s good, he is
coming upon us;�and, if he be detained but the veriest fraction of a prod-flight,
thou shalt surely have a cudgelling for thy supper. Come man!�open I tell thee.�
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb244">244</a>]</span></p>
<p>The huge iron bolts were now withdrawn from their fastenings, the key grated among
the rough wards of the lock, and the wicket was thrown back, whilst the Warder, peering
through the opening, seemed as if he were inclined to know something more of those
without, before he removed his own bulky person, that still blocked the passage. But
Dugald, stooping his head, sprang through the low aperture, and throwing his skull
right into the poor fellow�s stomach, with the force of a battering-ram, he laid him
sprawling on his back.
</p>
<p>�Hech!� cried the Warder, as he fell. �Hech me!�
</p>
<p>�Old fool that thou art!� cried Dugald, taking up the first word of quarrel with him;
�who was to think that thou wert to be standing in the very midst of the way?�Yet
I hope I have not hurt thee, for all that. Thou knowest, Rory, that I had rather hurt
myself than thee.�
</p>
<p>�Nay, nay,� said the old man, with a surly sort of acquiescence, as he was slowly
raising himself from the ground by means of Dugald�s assistance; during which operation
Patrick <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb245">245</a>]</span>Stewart, wrapped up in his plaid, and followed by the other two men, had made good
his entrance into the court-yard. �Nay, nay, I am not hurt. I�m no such eggshells,
i�faith. Yet what a fiend made thee so impatient? I behooved to be careful who I let
in, seeing that I was strictly charged to open to none but Murdoch Stewart himself
there,� pointing to Sir Patrick, who was standing a few paces aloof. �More by token,
I required to be all the warier, seeing that there was none living within the walls,
besides myself, save the old Knight Sir Allan, and the Lady Stradawn.�
</p>
<p>�How comes that?� demanded Dugald; �Though so many went to Curgarf, there were still
some left behind, surely.�
</p>
<p>�True enough, true enough,� replied the Warder. �But I know not what hath possessed
the lady. They have all been sent hither and thither, on some errand or another;�even
the very women folk have all gone forth.�
</p>
<p>Sir Patrick Stewart stood to hear no more, but making a signal to Dugald and the others
to follow him, he crossed the court-yard towards <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb246">246</a>]</span>the door of the keep tower, where they stood aside, whilst he knocked gently, yet
loud enough to be heard in the hall above. Soon afterwards, a timid and unsteady footstep
was heard descending the stair.
</p>
<p>�Open, good mother,� said Sir Patrick.
</p>
<p>�Oh, how thankful I am that thou art come!� said the Lady Stradawn, mistaking him
for her son Murdoch, their voices being a good deal like to each other, and opening
the door, pale and trembling, with a lamp in her hand, which the gust immediately
extinguished. �A plague on the wind, my lamp is out! But oh, I am thankful that thou
art come! �Tis fearful to be left alone in the house with a dead man, and one, too��Oh
�twas fearful!�
</p>
<p>�Dead!� cried Sir Patrick, with an accent of horror, which might have betrayed him,
but for the agitation which then possessed her whom he addressed. �A dead man, saidst
thou?�
</p>
<p>�Aye!� replied the lady, in a hollow tone, �aye! I saw that thou hadst yearnings.
Yet, after all, it was but giving him ease, by ridding him of a lingering life of
pain. It was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb247">247</a>]</span>kindness, in truth, to help him away from such misery. Yet, �tis no marvel that thou,
who art his very blood, should have some compunction. But thou mayest be at rest now,
for he is gone beyond thy help, or that of any one else.�
</p>
<p>�Gone!� exclaimed Sir Patrick again��Gone! how did he die?�
</p>
<p>�Horribly! most horribly!� replied the lady, shuddering. �It was fearful to behold
him in his agonies! Knowing, as I did, the potency of the poison, I could hardly have
believed that the old man would have taken so long to die.�
</p>
<p>�Horrible!� exclaimed Sir Patrick, involuntarily.
</p>
<p>�Aye, it was horrible!� replied the lady; �horrible indeed, as thou wouldst have said
if thou hadst seen it. For a moment, the poison seemed to have given him new strength,
and he rose from his chair as if he would have done vengeance on me. �Twas fearful
to behold him!�
</p>
<p>�Art sure he is quite dead?� said Sir Patrick again.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb248">248</a>]</span></p>
<p>�Aye,� replied the lady, �as dead as his son Walter; so dead, as to make thee surely
the Laird of Stradawn, the moment that thou shalt have made as sicker of Patrick,
as we may now soon hope thou wilt be able to do. I did but help him, as I was saying,
out of the pains and wretchedness of old age and dotage. Yet it was an awful work
for me. And oh, his last look was fearful! I wish I may ever be able to get rid of
it! Would that thou couldst have steeled thyself up to have done it thyself Murdoch!
But come in�come in quickly! Hast thou secured the prisoner?�
</p>
<p>�I have,� replied Sir Patrick, now exerting a certain degree of command over his feelings;
�he will be here anon.�
</p>
<p>�That is well,� replied the Lady Stradawn; �then all is thine own. His trial must
be short, and his execution speedy. But come, we have much to do to make things seemly
ere they arrive. He must appear to have died of a broken heart, caused by the wickedness
of his son. Every thing suspicious must be removed from about him. I could not dare
to touch <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb249">249</a>]</span>him. Why stand ye so long hesitating? But �tis no wonder, for I could not look upon
him myself without fancying that the devil was grinning over my shoulder. �Tis horrible
to think on�t! But come,� continued she, as she at last seemed to summon up resolution
to climb the stair; �lock the door, Murdoch, and follow me up quickly, for we have
no time to lose.�
</p>
<p>Sir Patrick Stewart made a signal to Dugald and the others, and then ascended to the
hall after the Lady Stradawn. A deathlike silence prevailed within it. A single lamp
was glimmering feebly on a sconce at the upper end of it: and there stood the lady,
pale and trembling, at that side of the chimney which was farthest from Sir Allan�s
chair. Sir Patrick, in his agitation, moved hurriedly forward; and the moment the
light of the lamp fell upon his features, the lady uttered a loud scream, and swooned
away upon the floor.
</p>
<p>The spectacle that now met his eyes harrowed up his very soul. His father lay dead
in his chair, with his features and his limbs fixed in the last frightful convulsion,
by which the racking <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb250">250</a>]</span>poison had terminated his existence. His mouth was twisted, his tongue thrust out,
and his eyeballs so fearfully staring, that even his tenderly affectionate son felt
it a dreadful effort to look upon that, which used to be to him an object of the deepest
veneration and love. Beside his chair was the small table, on which he was usually
served with his food. There stood a silver porringer containing the minced meat, which
his extreme age required; and notwithstanding all that the Lady Stradawn had said
to the contrary, the operation of the poison seemed to have been so quick, as to have
mortally affected him, ere he had taken the fourth part of the mess that had been
provided for him. Sir Patrick was overpowered by his feelings. He sank into a chair,
and covering his face with his hands, he gave way to his grief, in which he remained
so entirely absorbed, that neither the entrance of Dugald, nor the thundering which
some time afterwards took place at the outer gate, nor the noise of the many voices
of those who came pouring in, were sufficient to arouse him.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb251">251</a>]</span></p>
<p>Dugald Roy had the presence of mind to hurry down to the court-yard, to prepare the
Lord of Curgarf, and those who came with him, for the dreadful spectacle they were
to witness. Thunderstruck and shocked by his intelligence, they crowded up to the
hall, where the general horror was for some time so great, as to render every one
incapable of acting; but at length they gathered sufficient recollection to bestir
themselves. The poisoned porringer was first carefully preserved; the Lady Stradawn
was carried off in strong fits to her apartment; the body of Sir Walter Stewart was
borne up into the hall; and there, after undergoing the necessary preparations used
on such occasions, the father and son were laid out in state together, and the couches
on which the bodies rested were surrounded by so great a multitude of wax tapers,
as to exchange the melancholy gloom of the place into a blaze of light, which, reflected
as it was from the various pieces of armour that glittered in vain pomp upon the walls,
shone but to produce a greater intensity of sadness. The good priest of Dounan was
sent for; and the appalling <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb252">252</a>]</span>news having spread quickly around, the retainers began to swarm into the Castle, from
all quarters, in sorrowing groups, full of lamentation. Meanwhile the Lord of Curgarf
and his son, the Master of Forbes, occupied themselves in soothing the afflicted Sir
Patrick Stewart, and in aiding and encouraging him to go through with those trying
and painful duties which this most afflicting occasion demanded of him.
</p>
<p>Food and wine had been carried to the Lady Stradawn, where she sat alone in her bower,
so deeply sunk in remorse, and dejection, and dread, as to be quite unconscious of
the entrance or departure of those who brought her these comforts. Those who were
compelled to be the bearers of them, gazed on her with fear, and hastened from her
with expedition, and no one else could be persuaded to go near her, even her woman
refused to remain with her, as something accursed, so that she was left abandoned
by all, as a prey to her evil thoughts. Had any one ventured to look in upon her,
as she sat motionless in her great chair, with a lamp flickering on a table beside
her, and throwing an uncertain light by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb253">253</a>]</span>fits and snatches on her face, now pale and fixed as marble,�and on her glazed and
tearless eyes, and her dry and withered lips, he might have fancied that she was already
a corpse; yet deep, deep was the mental agony that she felt.
</p>
<p>The midnight watch had been set, and all had been for some time silent within the
walls of Drummin, save the distant hum of the subdued voices of those who, according
to custom, sat waking the corpses in the hall, when the door of the Lady Stradawn�s
bower opened, and her son Murdoch appeared. If the spirit of her murdered husband
had arisen before her eyes, she could not have started with more astonishment, or
recoiled with greater apparent horror.
</p>
<p>�Murdoch!� cried she, in a loud and agitated voice, �Is it thee, Murdoch?��And then,
sinking back into the same fixed and motionless attitude, whence she had been thus
momentarily aroused, she added, in a faint, low, and feeble tone, �Murdoch!�would
that thou hadst never been born!�
</p>
<p>�Mother,� said Murdoch, calmly shutting the door behind him, and taking a seat beside
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb254">254</a>]</span>her chair, �I have heard all from Nicol, the playfellow of my boyhood, who chanced
to be set to guard me, in the apartment below. I wished to see thee ere we die; and
I purchased from the sordid wretch this midnight hour�this last hour of privacy with
thee.�
</p>
<p>�Ha!� cried the Lady Stradawn, with a strange and sudden transition from the apathy
and torpor of despair, to the most energetic anxiety of hope; �If Nicol did that for
thee, why may we not bribe him to open a way for us through those who guard the gate?�Quick!�quick!�quick!�Oh,
let us quickly escape!�Oh, let us not tarry one moment longer! There are my keys;
we have treasure in that cabinet, which may well bribe him, and yet leave us rich!�
</p>
<p>�Be composed, my most worthy mother,� said Murdoch Stewart; �There is not the shadow
of a chance for us in that way. The door of the keep is doubly barred, and doubly
guarded, and no one leaves it unexamined beneath the light of a blazing torch. The
whole men-at-arms and clansmen within the walls, infuriated <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb255">255</a>]</span>against us, are of their own free will engaged in vigilant watching. The portcullis
is down, the gate barricaded, the barbican manned, and the walls surrounded by patroles.
Mother, cast aside all such hopes as useless, for as the guilt of both of us must
soon appear as clear as to-morrow�s noonday, so that sun, which shall certainly arise
to-morrow morning, shall as surely look upon our graves ere he sets.�
</p>
<p>The Lady Stradawn sank again into the chair, from which the sudden impulse of hope
had so energetically raised her, and, groaning deeply, she relapsed into her former
state of deathlike stillness, broken only by the long drawn sob that at certain intervals
convulsed her whole frame.
</p>
<p>�Mother!� said Murdoch Stewart, after a pause; �Where are all the fruits of that career
of crime for which thou nursed me as an infant, tutored me as a boy, and prompted
me as a man? Have I not followed thy bidding through deceit, robbery, and murder,
and where is now my reward?�Thine is locked up there in that secret cabinet of glittering
toys, which to-morrow <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb256">256</a>]</span>thou must leave, to go out to be hanged by the neck on the gallows-tree, with the
son, whom thou wouldst have had Lord of the Aven, grinning at thee like a caitiff
cur from the farther end of its beam��
</p>
<p>�Oh!�Oh�ho!� cried the agonized woman, shaken through every limb by the palsy of her
fears; �Is there no�no deliverance for us?�
</p>
<p>�Yes,� said Murdoch Stewart, calmly; �yes, there is a deliverance, and a speedy one
too.�
</p>
<p>�Oh, name it!� cried the frantic woman; �Oh, name it! and quickly let us avail ourselves
of it!�
</p>
<p>�Here it is,� said Murdoch Stewart, quietly taking a small paper packet from his bosom;
�Here it is, mother. A few small pinches of this powder, mingled in a cup of that
wine, will snatch us both from the torture of being made a disgraceful public spectacle
to-morrow�of being gazed at by the vulgar eyes, and pointed at by the vile fingers
of those wretched serfs, and their grovelling mates and spawn, whom, a little better
luck and better fortune for us, had by that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb257">257</a>]</span>time made the abject slaves of our will. See! here it is mingled, already it is dissolved,
and now the draught is potent. Good mother, I pledge thee,� said he, drinking down
half of what the goblet contained; �and now here is thy share.�
</p>
<p>�No,�no,�no!�I cannot!�no, I cannot!� cried the Lady Stradawn, with frantic horror
in her averted eyes.
</p>
<p>�Then do I tell thee, mother mine,� said Murdoch Stewart sternly; �thou hast not trained
me up to deal in deeds of blood and death for naught. I shall never suffer thy womanish
fears to bring the disgrace of the gallows upon thee. I love thee too much for that.
See here, good mother! �tis but a choice of deaths. Here is a concealed dagger, look
you. Say! wouldst thou bring one more murder�the murder of a mother on my already
overburdened soul, to sink it deeper in that sea of torment, to which these priests
would fain have us believe that those, who, like us, have used the wit and the strength
with which they have been gifted, for bettering their own condition in this world,
must hasten <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb258">258</a>]</span>from hence. Drink! or by every fiend that suffers there, thou diest in the instant!�
</p>
<p>The Lady Stradawn glared at her son with a vacant stare, as if all reason had fled
from her. She took the cup mechanically from his hand, and drained it to the bottom.
</p>
<p>�What hast thou done?� cried the man-at-arms, who had been brought to the door by
the violent tone of some of Murdoch Stewart�s last words, and who rushed in just as
the Lady Stradawn had swallowed the poison.
</p>
<p>�Do what thou wilt now, Nicol,� said Murdoch Stewart, with perfect composure; �We
are both beyond thy power, or that of any one else within the castle of Drummin.�
</p>
<p>Nicol at once guessed at what had happened, and ran instantly for the Priest. The
good Father of Dounan was deeply skilled in medicine, as well as in divinity. He called
for assistance, and antidotes were forcibly given to Murdoch Stewart, and passively
received by his mother the Lady Stradawn. Their wretched existence was thus prolonged,
though death could not be altogether averted. They lingered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb259">259</a>]</span>on, in great pain, for many days, during which all judicial proceedings were suspended.
The pious priest lost not one moment of this precious time. By exerting all his religious
learning, and all his eloquence, he at length succeeded in bringing both of them to
a full sense of the enormity of their guilt, as well as to an ample confession of
all their crimes. It is not for us to interpret the decrees of the Almighty in such
a case as theirs; but if the apparent deep contrition that followed was real, and
heartfelt, we may trust that the mercy, as well as the benefit of the merits of that
blessed Saviour, who died for us all upon the cross, even for the thief that was crucified
with him, was extended to them, dreadful as their crimes had been.
</p>
<p>My legend now draws to a hasty conclusion. The days of mourning were fully numbered
by Sir Patrick Stewart, for his murdered father and brother. The kindness of the old
Lord of Curgarf, and his son Arthur Master of Forbes, towards him, was unwearied and
most consolatory. Nor were the delicate affections of the Lady Catherine Forbes less
tenderly or unremittingly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb260">260</a>]</span>displayed, so that, in due time, by becoming her husband, he bound himself to both
his friends by the closest and dearest ties. In pious remembrance of his brother Sir
Walter�s murder, he erected the pillar of stone I spoke of, as that which stood so
long by the side of the well-eye where he was slain; but he refrained from inscribing
any thing upon it, lest his doing so might have revived the recollection of Murdoch
Stewart�s atrocity. He likewise ordered a stone to be set up, where the proud Priest
of Dalestie was burned, rather as a sort of expiation of the stern act of justice,
which his brother Sir Walter had inflicted upon him, than to perpetuate the detested
memory of the depraved wretch who suffered there.

<h2 class="main">FATE OF THE OULD AUNCIENT MONUMENTS.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">Clifford</span><span class="corr" id="xd29e2203" title="Not in source">.</span>�(<i>as we arose to pursue our journey</i>.)�And what became of these two monuments, Serjeant Stewart?
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant.</span>�A certain gentleman, who was building a house somewhere in this neighbourhood, (for
I had rather not designate him too particularly,) cast his eyes on the fine stone
that stood by the well-eye, and perceiving that it would make an excellent lintel,
he took immediate measures to get it carried off to his rising edifice. Having accomplished
his intention, with no little difficulty, it was speedily employed in the building,
where it promised to conduct itself with the same quiet and decorum which were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb262">262</a>]</span>observed by all the other stones of the edifice, after being put to rest, each in
his separate bed of mortar. But no sooner did the house come to be inhabited, than
it began to be haunted by strange and mysterious noises. Some of these were quite
unintelligible, for they resembled no earthly sound that had ever been heard before.
Then long conversations began, and were continued, in small sharp clear voices; but
although the words fell distinctly enough on the ears of those who heard them, the
language was as a sealed book to them. And ever and anon the seeming dialogue would
be interrupted by strange uncouth fits of laughter, as if of several persons together,
or in different parts of the premises, that were so far from creating a corresponding
disposition to mirth or merriment in the listeners, that they froze up the very blood
in their veins. But this was not all. The most dismal croaking of frogs arose in every
part of the house. You would have sworn that the creatures were in the cup-boards�the
presses�the chimnies�in the beds�on the floors�nay, on the very tables, and among
the dishes which the good folks of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb263">263</a>]</span>the family had set before them. It was as if the frogs, that formed the great plague
in Egypt, had filled the house with their hoarse voices. One would begin as if he
were the leader of the band, and then others would start off, one after another, till
the doleful chorus, resounding from all quarters, made the concert loud and sonorous.
It was no uncommon thing, during the dark and dreary watches of the night, for the
voice of the leader, which had something peculiarly striking in it, to arise of a
sudden, as if he that uttered it was sitting astraddle on the nose of the goodman
of the house. In vain was the hand applied to the organ, to drive off what, in reality,
appeared to be the organist. There was nothing there; yet the sound continued as if
it had come from the deepest pipe in the organ loft of some cathedral, yea, of that
of the great organ of Haerlem itself. The more he rubbed the more it grew, and the
louder and more universal became the chorus. His very nose itself increased in size,
from the frequent and severe rubbings to which it was thus subjected, whilst he began
to grow thin and emaciated in proportion, till his whole person <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb264">264</a>]</span>at length appeared rather as if it had been an appendage to his nose, than his nose
an appendage to his person. At last, being worn out in spirit, as he was very nearly
in body also, he was fain to take out the stone from the building, and to carry it
back to the hill-side again, and then, to be sure, he enjoyed perfect quiet.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Clifford.</span>�A sensible man, truly. But what had evil spirits or fairies to do with a monumental
stone?
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant.</span>�Nothing that I can see, sir, except that being guilty of so impious a deed as the
removal of such a stone, he was for a time left unprotected by all good angels, and
consequently he was altogether at the mercy of those evil ones.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Grant.</span>�Very well made out, Mister Serjeant. But where is the stone now?
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant.</span>�Why, sir, I am sure you will hardly believe me when I tell you, that a few years
ago it was wantonly destroyed by another gentleman, who shall be also nameless.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Grant.</span>�What a Goth he must have been! Why should you conceal his name, Serjeant?�It deserves
to be held up to public reprobation
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb265">265</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant.</span>�I know my own interest too well to be the officious person who shall publish it though.
Yet I must own that it would have served him right that it should have been so marked.
What do you think he did, gentlemen? Happening to be in this part of Strathdawn, he,
without rhyme or reason, and out of sheer wickedness, ordered his people to break
both that and the <i>Clach-na-Tagart</i>, or the Priest�s stone, which shocking pieces of barbarism he took care to see executed
in his own presence, whilst he stood by, like a mischievous baboon, chuckling over
their destruction.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Clifford.</span>�The fellow deserved to have been plunged over head and ears into the Wallee in the
first place, and after being thus well soaked, he ought to have been leisurely consumed
at the Priest�s stone, like a well watered sack of Newcastle coals.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant.</span>�Why, sir, I must allow that he has been punished severely enough. The whole people
of the country cried out upon him, and every one declared that it was quite impossible
that the fellow could thrive, after having demolished <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb266">266</a>]</span>two such ould auncient antiquities. And so in truth it turned out, for not long afterwards
he lost the whole <i>fushon</i><a class="noteref" id="xd29e2255src" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#xd29e2255">1</a> of his side. As for the Clach-na-Tagart, the Roman Catholics, who form the chief
population hereabouts, intended to have clasped it together with iron bands, but,
(<i>addressing author</i>,) as you know very well, sir, from having recorded the fact in your book, the great
flood of August 1829 saved them the trouble of doing so, for the Aven then carried
the broken stone clean away, aye, and it swept off the best part of the haugh it stood
upon into the bargain.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Grant.</span>�But stay, my good friend, Archy. What do you mean by quitting the level path to climb
this confounded steep hill, as the direction of your nose, at this moment, would seem
to indicate your present intention to be?
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant.</span>�I would fain show you an extensive prospect, gentlemen. It is only a bit start of
a pull up here. A mere breathing for you after the long rest you had by the water
side <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb267">267</a>]</span>yonder.�(<i>Then addressing the gilly.</i>)�My man, hold you on the road to Inchrory with the horse, and tell the gudewife there
that we are coming.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Clifford.</span>��Tis a very stiff pull, Archy. But we shall be all the better for something of this
sort to put us in wind. I calculate that we shall have some worse climbing than this
before we are done with these mountains.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant.</span>�Troth, you may well say that, sir; and as for this hill, we may be very thankful
that we have not to climb it with a strong demonstration of the enemies� riflemen
lining the ridge of it.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Clifford.</span>�You are out there, serjeant. Depend upon it, if we saw an enemy lining the height,
we should both of us climb it like roebucks, to be at them.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant.</span>�I�m not saying but we might, sir; that is, if we saw that we were sufficiently well
backed. But for all that, we might find our graves before we were half way up the
hill; and then what the better should we be, of our comrades saying, as they passed
by us, �Poor fellows, you are settled!� Would that be any <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb268">268</a>]</span>consolation to us, as we lay writhing in the last agonies?
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Grant.</span>�Very small consolation indeed, Archy.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant.</span>�I wot it would be little indeed, sir. Yet ought a man to do his duty for all that,
simply because it is his duty. Many is the time I have heard my good friend Captain
Ketley say that; and there were few words fell from his mouth that had not some good
sense, or some good moral in them. And certain it is, that if we did not always keep
this rule of our conduct in view, we should neither be good sodgers nor good Christians.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Clifford.</span>�Right again, old boy.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant.</span>�And yet, Mr. Clifford, as I reckon, there is some pleasure in coming out of the skrimmage
in a whole skin, and with ears that can hear all the honest commendations that are
bestowed upon your own brave and gallant conduct.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Grant</span>�(<i>after reaching the summit of the hill</i>.)�That was indeed a breather; but now, Serjeant, for the prospect you promised us,
I see <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb269">269</a>]</span>nothing as yet but the bare flat moist moory hill-top.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant</span>�(<i>leading us to the eastern verge of the top of the hill</i>.)�Come this way, then, gentlemen. See here what an extensive prospect you have down
the course of the river Don. It looks but a small stream there, especially from this
height.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Author.</span>�What old castle is that which we see below us there, near yonder clump of trees?
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant.</span>�That is Curgarf Castle. That is the very spot to which so much of my legend referred,
though I shall not pretend to say that the building you see there is precisely the
same. But now, gentlemen, turn your eyes westward again. Is not that a fine mountain
view? See how proudly the Cairngorms rise yonder! But, observe me�you don�t see the
very highest summits as yet, because those big black lumps opposite to us there, hide
the highest tops from our eyes.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Author.</span>�It is a magnificent scene notwithstanding, especially as viewed at present, under
that splendid display of evening light, that is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb270">270</a>]</span>now shooting over those loftier ridges from the descending sun.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Grant.</span>�A very grand scene indeed!
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Clifford.</span>�Aye, Grant, we shall have some climbing there, I promise you.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Grant.</span>�There can be little doubt of that. But tell me, Serjeant, what solitary house is
that we see in the valley below?
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Author.</span>�I can answer you that question. That is Inchrory, the small place, half farm-house,
half hostel, where we are to sojourn to-night. It is used as a place of rest and refreshment,
by the few travellers who pass on foot, or on horseback, by the rugged path which
we left in the valley, and which goes hence southwards, up through the valley of the
Builg�past the lake of that name,�so across what is there the rivulet of the Don,�and
then onwards over the hills to Castleton of Braemar. That deep hollow in the mountains,
that turns sharp westwards beyond Inchrory yonder, is what is more properly called
Glenaven. The river Aven comes pouring down hitherwards through it, and our way lies
up its course.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb271">271</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="sc">Clifford.</span>�I should be sorry if it did so this evening. I am quite prepared to hail yonder house
of Inchrory below, as a welcome place of refuge for this night.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Author.</span>�Few places must be more welcome to a wayworn traveller than Inchrory, especially
when first descried by the weary wayfarer from Castleton, in a winter�s evening, as
the sun is hasting downwards.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant.</span>�You are not far wrong there, sir. A dreadful hill journey that is, indeed, from Castleton
to Inchrory, amid the storms of winter. Not a vestige of a house by the way. Many
a poor wretch has perished in the snow, amidst these trackless wastes. Not to go very
far back, there was a terrible snow storm about the Martinmas time in the 1829. It
roared, and blew, and drifted so fast, that it was mid-day or ever Mrs. Shaw of Inchrory
ventured to put her head out beyond the threshold of her own door, to look at the
thick and dreary shroud of white in which dead nature was wrapped, and which covered
the whole lonely scene of hill and valley around her, and was in many places <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb272">272</a>]</span>blown into wreathes of a great depth. There was not a speck of colour, nor any moving
thing to vary the glazed unbroken surface, except on one distant hillock, where a
single human figure was seen, wandering to and fro, as if in a maze, like some one
bereft of reason. The male inhabitants of the house were all out looking after the
stock belonging to the grazing farm; and, as Mrs. Shaw was in doubt whether the person
she beheld might not in reality be some one who was deranged, as his movements rather
seemed to indicate, she was afraid to venture to approach him. But curiosity as well
as pity made her cast many a look towards him during that afternoon, as he still continued
to move slowly round the hillock, and backwards and forwards, without any apparent
sense or meaning, and stopping now and then, as if utterly bewildered. At length,
as it was drawing towards night, Mrs. Shaw observed that the figure had either fallen,
or lain down among the snow, and her charitable feelings then overcoming all her apprehensions,
she proceeded to wade through the snow towards the hillock where he lay. Having, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb273">273</a>]</span>with very considerable difficulty, made her way to the spot, she found him lying on
his back, as composedly as if he had lain down in his bed. The intense cold had so
benumbed his intellects, indeed, that he did not seem to be in the least aware of
his own melancholy situation.��Wha are ye? and what are ye wantin?� said he, to Mrs.
Shaw, with a faint smile on his emaciated face, as he beheld her stooping over him
with an anxious gaze of inquiry. �I came to help you,� replied Mrs. Shaw; �Will you
let me try to lift you up?���Thank you, I can rise mysel�,� replied he, making a vain
effort to get up.��You had better let me help you,� said Mrs. Shaw.��Ou, na, thank
ye,� replied he again; �I can rise weel eneugh mysel.���Do so, then,� said Mrs. Shaw,
whilst at the same time she prepared herself for giving him her best assistance during
his attempt. In this way, a strong effort on her part enabled her at last to succeed
in getting the poor man on his legs; and then, after the expenditure of as much time
as might have easily enabled her to have gone five or six <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb274">274</a>]</span>miles, and with immense labour and fatigue, this heroic woman was finally successful
in supporting him, or rather, I should say, in half carrying him to Inchrory. When
she had got him fairly out of the snow, and into the house, she had the horror to
discover, that not only were his shoes and stockings gone, but that even the very
flesh was worn off his feet. When help arrived, they got him into bed, and did all
for him that charitable Christians could do. Food was brought to him, but it was some
time before he could be made to swallow any portion of it, and that only by feeding
him like a child. The poor fellow turned out to be a young man of the name of Thomas
Macintosh, servant to the Rev. Mr. MacEachan, the Roman Catholic priest at Castleton,
which place he had left on the Wednesday morning, and he had wandered among the snow,
without food or shelter, and becoming every moment more and more bewildered, until
the Friday evening, when Mrs. Shaw�s praiseworthy exertions brought him to her house.
On the Saturday, the good people <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb275">275</a>]</span>carried him down the valley to the next farm, on his way to the doctor. But, alas!
no doctor was ever destined to do him any good, for he died that same evening. Two
one pound notes, and a few shillings, were found in his pocket, which sum went to
pay the expense of his interment in the newly made church-yard at Tomantoul, of which,
as it so happened, he was the second tenant.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Grant.</span>�What a melancholy fate!
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant.</span>�Sad, indeed, sir. But there are many stories of the same kind connected with this
wild path through these desolate mountains.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Author.</span>�Do you remember any more of them, Archy?
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant.</span>�Ou, yes, sir. It was upon that terrible night of drift, the 25th of November, 1826,
no farther gone, when so many poor people perished, that a man, three women, and two
horses, were buried in the snow upon yon hill, which is called Cairn Elsach, as they
were on their way back from the Tomantoul market. So deep was the snow in many places,
that one of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb276">276</a>]</span>the horses was found frozen stiff dead, and the beast was so supported in it, as to
be sticking upright upon his legs, and a woman was discovered standing dead beside
him. Some little time afterwards, a shepherd, who happened to have occasion to cross
the hill, had his attention attracted by some long hair which was seen above the icy
surface, waving in the wintry blast. On scraping away the snow, he found that it was
attached to a woman�s head, who had unfortunately perished. He procured the assistance
of some of his friends, who were afraid to dig out the body for fear it might have
become offensive. I, who chanced to be there, had no such scruples, first, because
I knew very well that the snow must have preserved it, and, secondly, because, if
it had been otherwise, I knew that I had lost my sense of smelling in consequence
of the desperate wound in my jaw, of which I told you. When the snow was removed,
the poor young woman�s body was found quite fresh and entire, but it was perfectly
blue in colour.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Author.</span>�These are melancholy details; yet, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb277">277</a>]</span>it must be confessed, they are quite in harmony with the wild and lonely scenery now
before our eyes.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Grant.</span>�They remind one of the horrors of the Alps.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Clifford.</span>�The gaunt wolves are wanting, though, to make up the picture completely.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant.</span>�We had the wolves also ourselves once upon a time, sir; and now the corby, and the
hill-fox, and the eagle, do their best to make up for the want of them. But such a
wilderness as this, covered deep with snow, and the howling wind carrying the drift
across it, has quite terrors enough in it for my taste.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Author.</span>�I am quite of your opinion, Archy.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant.</span>�Yet it is wonderful how Providence will interfere to preserve people alive, amidst
such complicated horrors. I remember a story of a man of the name of Macintosh, who
left Braemar, with his wife, to come over this way. A dreadful snow storm came upon
them, and, being blinded by the snow-drift, and encumbered in the deep and heavy wreathes,
the poor people were separated from each other. The man <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb278">278</a>]</span>made his way, with great difficulty, to a whisky bothy, where he arrived much exhausted,
and quite inconsolable for the loss of his wife. Being thus saved himself, he procured
the assistance of people to help him to look for the corpse of his lost partner. For
two whole days they sought in vain; when, just as they were about to abandon their
search, till the surface of the ground should become less burdened with snow, they
observed a figure coming slowly and wearily down the hill of Gart. This, as it drew
nearer, appeared to be a woman; and, on her approaching nearer still, the overjoyed
husband discovered that she was his living wife, for whom he had been weeping as dead.
She had been wandering for nearly three days, without either food or shelter, amid
the mountain snows, but, although she was dreadfully exhausted, she eventually recovered.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Grant.</span>�That was indeed the support of Providence, Archy!
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Author.</span>�Most wonderful indeed! Her preservation was little short of a miracle.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant.</span>�Aye, truly, you may well say <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb279">279</a>]</span>that, sir. Nothing but a miracle could have preserved the poor woman from so many
perils as she must have encountered in her wanderings,�not to mention those of cold,
hunger, and fatigue. It was the hand of Providence, assuredly, that supported her.
By what means he worked, we have no opportunity of knowing. But surely it was strange
that he could have enabled any human being, and especially a woman, to have come through
so much fatigue and suffering alive.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Clifford.</span>�Truly, most miraculous!
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant.</span>�And then, gentlemen, how very strangely�so far as we blind mortals can perceive�are
others permitted to perish at the very door, as it were, of help. I think it is now
about sixteen years ago�and, if I remember rightly, it was about the Christmas time�that
James Stewart, son of the miller of Delnabo, perished, on the very haugh there, just
below the House of Inchrory. The poor fellow passed by this place, on his way over
to Braemar, one morning that I happened to be here. He stopped a few minutes with
me, and had some <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb280">280</a>]</span>talk.��I�m likely to get a fine day for crossing the hill, Archy,� said he.��Well,�
said I, �I hope you will, and I wish you may. Yet I don�t altogether like yon <i>mountaneous</i> heap of white tumbling-looking clouds, that are casting up afar off over the hill-top
yonder.���They dinna look awthegither weel, to be sure,� said Jemmy; �but I houp I
may be in weel kent land lang or they break.��We parted. The snow came on in a dreadful
storm, about mid-day; and I had two or three anxious thoughts about Jemmy Stewart,
as the recollection of him was ever and anon brought back to me, during the night,
by the fearful whistling of the wind, and the rattling of the hail. Next morning,
I, and some of the other men about the place, found a human track, running in a bewildered,
irregular, and uncertain line, between the house of Inchrory and the burn yonder,
which must be a width of not much more than forty yards. We had not followed this
far, when we came to the poor man, whose worn-out feet had made these prints. His
walking-stick was standing erect among the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb281">281</a>]</span>snow beside him,�and there lay poor Jemmy Stewart, on his face; his hands were closed,
and his head rested on them, just as if he had lain quietly down to sleep. The lads
who were with me, stupid gomerills that they were, had a superstitious dread of touching
him; but, deeply as I grieved for the poor fellow, I had seen too many dead men in
my time to have any such scruples. I accordingly turned him, and found, alas! that
he was quite gone. It appeared that he had been suddenly surprised and bewildered
by the snow-drift among the hills, and that, having lost all knowledge of his way,
he had unconsciously wandered in the very opposite direction to that in which he had
intended to go. Becoming more and more confused, as he wandered and wandered, he became
at last so entirely stupified by the multiplied terrors of that awful night, that
he ultimately yielded to the last drowsiness of death, and so laid himself down to
court its fatal repose. Alas! he was unhappily ignorant that he was within a few yards
of the friendly house which he had passed on his way upwards on the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb282">282</a>]</span>previous morning, to the reviving shelter of which, the least possible additional
exertion might have easily brought him, had he but known in what direction to have
made it.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Clifford.</span>�What a sad and fearful story!
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant.</span>�Aye, sir, sad and fearful indeed! Is it not dreadful to think how often the recollection
of him crossed my mind during that fatal night, and how little trouble, on my part,
would have saved him, had I only known that he was wandering in the snow so near me?
Aye, and to think that I should have lain ignorantly all the while in my warm bed,
allowing him so cruelly to perish! Willing would I have been to have travelled all
night through the drift to have saved poor Jemmy Stewart!
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Author.</span>�No one can doubt that, Archy.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant.</span>�Well, but sir, you see these matters are in the hand of God, and at his wise disposal;
and although we, blind moles of the yearth as we are, cannot easily descry why a worthy
well-doing young man like Jemmy Stewart should be permitted thus wretchedly to die,
without aid, either human or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb283">283</a>]</span>divine, we cannot doubt the justice and wisdom of God�s ways, which are inscrutable,
and past man�s finding out. Well, I did all I could for the poor fellow, for I had
his corpse carried down to his afflicted father at Delnabo, and I saw him buried at
Dounan, near the Bridge of Livat.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Clifford.</span>�That, indeed, was all you could do for the poor man, Archy; and the manner in which
you did that little, together with all the sentiments that you have uttered regarding
him, are enough to convince any one that you would not have scrupled to peril your
life, if you could have thereby saved that of a fellow-creature, still more that of
a friend.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant.</span>�Thank you, sir, for your good opinion of me; but, as I said before, these matters
are in the hand of God: and, whilst he allows the strong to perish, he can, if he
so wills it, preserve the weakest. I remember an extraordinary circumstance that happened
about eighteen or twenty years ago, which I may mention to you as an example of the
truth of this observe of mine. Four women, who had been in the south country <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb284">284</a>]</span>at the harvest, were on their return home over these mountains, when they were caught
in a storm. The snow came on so thickly upon them, and the wind raised so great a
land-drift, that they became bewildered, lost their way, and, after much wandering,
they at last got into the ruins of an old bothy, near the side of the river Gairden,
which runs, as I may tell ye, beyond those farther hills there to the south. By this
time their shoes were worn off. They were without food�without all means of making
a fire�and the cold came on so intense during the night, that the poor things were
all frozen to death. There they were found in the morning by a party of smugglers,
who had been early a-stir after their trade. The whole of the four women were cold
and stiff. But the most wonderful, as well as the most touching circumstance of all
was, that a female child, of about sixteen months old, was found alive, vainly attempting
to draw nourishment from its mother�s breast. The poor woman�s maternal anxiety had
enabled her to use precautions to keep her babe warm and in life, which she had failed
to exercise for her own <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb285">285</a>]</span>preservation. The child was taken charge of by Donald Shaw of Lagganall, and brought
up by him under the name of Kirstock; and she afterwards went to service in Glen Livat,
where��But mark me now, gentlemen! Here we are at Caochan-Seirceag, of which you heard
so much from me in my Legend of the Clan-Allan Stewarts.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Clifford.</span>�I see there are no trees here now, as you say there were in the days of Sir Patrick
Stewart of Clan-Allan.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Grant.</span>�The cliffs are fine though, and the ravine itself romantic. How comes it that some
of these rocks are so brilliantly white? They absolutely shine like alabaster amid
the dazzling radiance of that setting sun.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Author.</span>�If I answer your question, it will draw me into a disquisition which may bring an
attack upon us from Clifford, for prosing about geology to one another.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Grant.</span>�Never mind him; he may shut his ears, if he likes.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Author.</span>�Those brilliant streaks of alabastrine white, are nothing more than incrustations
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb286">286</a>]</span>of calcareous stalactites, formed on those rocks of gneiss, by the evaporation of
these trickling rills, the water of which holds lime in solution, probably derived
from the little aquatic marl snail in the moss above, from which they drain themselves.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Clifford.</span>�I�d advise you to think less of your alabastrine incrustations of calcareous stalactites
on gneiss, and more of your necks and limbs, during this steep and somewhat hazardous
descent, else you may evaporate like some of those trickling rills you are speaking
of. These fellows you told us of, Mr. Serjeant, must have had some little difficulty
in carrying the Lady Catherine down and up here. But tell me, I pray you, what is
the meaning of the name of Caochan-Seirceag? for I know that all your Gaelic names
of places are highly poetical and descriptive.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant.</span>�The meaning of Caochan-Seirceag, sir, so far as I can make it out, is <i>the rivulet of the beloved maiden</i>.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Clifford.</span>�Poetical in the highest degree!�Why, what scope does it not afford to the poet�s
mind to fancy the ardour of the passion of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb287">287</a>]</span>lovers who must have made the romantic bed of this rivulet their trysting place, as
well as the beauty of the maiden by whose beloved image the youth thus happily chose
to distinguish it�to imagine all the obstacles which the pure stream of their love
may have encountered in its course, and of which this vexed and tortured little brook
may have formed but too lively a type, until at length it glided into a peaceful channel,
as this does in its passage across the green meadow yonder below! What a glorious
poetical romance might be suggested by these rocks and rills!�Confound them!�I had
nearly tumbled headlong over this slippery stone!�What a fall I should have had!
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Grant.</span>�You made a narrow escape there, indeed, Clifford. I would have you to remember, that
it would have been quite as bad to have died the victim of romantic enthusiasm, as
of dry geological speculation.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Clifford.</span>�I beg your pardon, my good fellow, you are quite wrong there. I at least would have
infinitely preferred to have died from thinking <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb288">288</a>]</span>of the beloved maiden, than from a confusion of brain occasioned by a mixture of alabastrine
incrustations of calcareous stalactites and gneiss and marl snails! But to return
to my speculations as to the rivulet of the beloved maiden,�why may it not have had
its name from the Lady Catherine Forbes herself?
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant.</span>�As I shall answer, you have hit the very thing, sir. There cannot be a doubt that
it was from her that the rill was so called.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Clifford.</span>�See now how lucky it was for you, Mister Archy, that I was not killed by a fall,
as I had so nearly been, else had you been deprived of my ingenious elucidation of
this most difficult point. But now, thank heaven, we are all safe in the meadow, and
I shall have one touch at the trouts yet ere the light goes away entirely.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Author.</span>�I wish you great success, Clifford. Pray do your best, my good fellow, for I know
not what commons we may have in this our hostel of Inchrory here.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Clifford.</span>�Aha! you see that my rod and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb289">289</a>]</span>my piscatorial skill are not without their use. Depend upon it, you shan�t go without
a supper, if I can help it.
</p>
<p>As I suspected, we found that our accommodations at Inchrory were rather of the simplest
description. But the good people of the house showed every disposition to do the best,
for our comfort, that lay in their power. A dozen and a half of large trouts, which
Clifford soon brought in, added to some of those provisions which we carried with
us, made up the best part of our repast, and we very speedily prepared ourselves for
the intellectual enjoyment of the evening.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Clifford.</span>�One would think that the worthy people here, had been forewarned of our story-telling
propensities, and that they had made especial provision accordingly for the serjeant�s
long yarns. Did you ever see a more magnificent pair of wax candles on any table?
Why, these would see out all the narratives that ever were told by Sindbad the Sailor.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Grant.</span>�Who could have expected to have met with wax candles, such as these, in an humble
place like this, in the midst of these <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb290">290</a>]</span>lonely mountains, and so far from the haunts of men? Nay, who could have expected
to have met with any candles at all here?
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Author.</span>�How happens it, Archy, that they can give us candles so superb as these, in a place
like this, where they have so little else to produce, and nothing at all that can
in the least degree correspond with them? They are of enormous size�nearly three inches
in diameter, I should say. I have seen no such candles as these, except in a Roman
Catholic church, or procession.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant.</span>�Troth, sir, I imagine you have solved the mystery. The truth is, as I told you before,
that the great mass of the population of this Highland country consists of Roman Catholics;
and it is probable that these candles, which have been originally used for some religious
rite, have, from necessity, been this night lighted for your use.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Clifford.</span>�Come, then, serjeant, do you proceed to use the candles as fast as may be. Open your
budget, my good man, and give us one of your many legends.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb291">291</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="sc">Grant.</span>�You had better allow the serjeant to mix a tumbler of warm stuff in the first place,
and whilst he is doing so, he can be considering as to what he had best give us.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant.</span>�Thank you, sir. I�ll just be doing that same. Would you have any objections to another
legend of the Clan-Allan Stewarts, gentlemen?
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Author.</span>�Certainly not, Archy, if it be only as good as the last you gave us.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant.</span>�It is not for me to speak in its praise, sir, though I must e�en say that I think
it no worse than the last. But it is a hantel longer.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Grant.</span>�The longer the better, if it be good. We have a long night, and great candles before
us, so that you may give your tongue its fullest licence.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Serjeant.</span>�Well, gentlemen, it�s a good thing to be neither gagged in the mouth, nor stinted
in the bicker.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Author.</span>�Depend upon it, Archy, you shall be neither the one nor the other.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58913/58913-h/58913-h.htm#pb292">292</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="sc">Clifford.</span>�Come away, then, serjeant, begin as soon as you please.
</p>
<p>Archy then took a long snuff out of the box which I handed to him, during which he
seemed to be collecting his ideas, and then he began his narrative. Although I regret
that I cannot always give the precise words used by him, I shall endeavour to preserve
as faithful an outline of its particulars as I can, and that in language which I hope
may be at least as intelligible.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
